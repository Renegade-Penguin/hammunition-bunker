# Offline catalogue — Bunker (Plan B) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** A Bunker that publishes a signed, versioned catalogue of everything it holds (`catalogue.json` v3 plus one `ssh-keygen -Y sign` signature per configured key), keeps the signing keys (file, FIDO2 security key, ssh-agent/PIV) under its own `bunker keys` commands, records the publisher facts and plan-time inputs the engine needs to plan with publishers unreachable, holds the remaining data kinds, payloads and git bundles, filters group-mode shares, exports the same layout to a drive, and proves the whole chain once in a network namespace where only the Bunker answers.

**Architecture:** The engine owns the reader and the shared rules (`hammunition.catalogue`, `hammunition.keystrength`, `hammunition.signers`); the Bunker imports them through `src/bunker/enginelib.py` and never re-implements them. The Bunker owns the writer. A run keeps its working state in `<root>/.state.json` (the v3 document, unsigned, written after every artifact) and publishes `catalogue.json` plus `catalogue.sig.d/<n>.sig` exactly once at the end of a run, through `src/bunker/publish.py` and `src/bunker/signing.py`, so the served pair is always one signed catalogue and a touch-required token is tapped once per change, not once per artifact. The server serves only what the published catalogue names.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+, stdlib only (`subprocess` for `ssh-keygen`, `git`, `fido2-token`, `opensc-tool`; `http.server`), pytest, mypy --strict, ruff; the engine as a library from its pinned release.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-offline-bunker-catalogue-design.md` in Renegade-Penguin/Hammunition (checkout read while writing this plan: `/home/chiefgyk3d/src/Hammunition-offline-bunker/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-offline-bunker-catalogue-design.md`)

**Contract:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-07-offline-bunker-contract.md` in Renegade-Penguin/Hammunition (checkout: `/home/chiefgyk3d/src/Hammunition-offline-bunker/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-07-offline-bunker-contract.md`); binding, not edited here.

**Depends on:** Plan A (`/home/chiefgyk3d/src/Hammunition-offline-bunker/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-07-offline-bunker-engine.md`, 19 tasks), released: the engine release that contains Plan A (`hammunition.catalogue`, `hammunition.keystrength`, `hammunition.signers`, `hammunition.gitbundles`, the `inputs` and `git_pins` arrays of `artifacts --json`, `mirror enrol`, `install --offline`). The tag is decided at release (Plan A ships in v0.22.0 only if nothing else claims that number): Task 11 holds the number in one shell variable, `ENGINE`, and nothing else in this plan depends on it. Tasks 1 to 10 are written and tested against a local checkout of the Plan A branch installed per CONTRIBUTING.md ("Developing against an unreleased engine"); tests that need a Plan A module go through `tests/plan_a.py` (skip until Task 11 turns the skip into a failure). Every engine name, signature and message this plan relies on was read in Plan A; what Plan A leaves undefined and Plan B needs is listed under "Needs from Plan A" at the end.

## Global Constraints

- Python floor: `requires-python = ">=3.11"`; ruff `target-version = "py311"`, `line-length = 100`; no syntax newer than 3.11.
- mypy: `strict = true`, `python_version = "3.11"`, `warn_unreachable = true`, `show_error_codes = true`, over `src`, `tests`, `packaging`; no new `# type: ignore` without an error code and a reason.
- ruff `select = ["E","F","W","I","UP","B","SIM","S","RUF"]`; a `subprocess` call in `src/` carries `# noqa: S603 - <reason>`; tests already ignore `S101`, `S603`, `S607`, `S108`.
- GYST pins untouched: every `uses: ChiefGyk3D/git-your-ship-together/...@fde2a491de5107c4edb953c8d24f04835c11cb0a # v1.13.0` line stays byte-identical; the only workflow edit in this plan is the `install-command` and `test-command` values of `ci.yml` in Task 10; `tests/test_packaging.py::test_gyst_pins_agree` stays green.
- No `shell=True` anywhere; every subprocess is an argv list with `check=False`, an explicit return-code branch and a timeout.
- No real hardware in CI: no test opens `/dev/hidraw*`, talks to `pcscd`, or needs a token; FIDO2 and PIV paths run against `tests/signing_fakes.py` or a stub runner, and file/agent keys are real `ssh-keygen` keys generated in `tmp_path`.
- New examples and fixtures use `europe/monaco` or `north-america/us/delaware` only; no callsign, grid square or real selection anywhere (placeholders `N0CALL`, `FN31pr`); existing tests keep the regions they already use.
- Every task ends green on `make check` (ruff, ruff format --check, mypy, pytest); run `make format` first, because the code blocks in this plan are not pre-formatted to ruff's style, then `make check; echo "exit=$?"` and read the exit code, never pipe the gate into `grep`.
- Commits are authored `ChiefGyk3D <19499446+ChiefGyk3D@users.noreply.github.com>` and end with the attribution line the session gives; the branch is pushed and merged by the maintainer, never by the implementer.
- A private signing key never leaves `<root>/.keys/` (0700, files 0600) and never appears in the catalogue, a log line, a `--json` document or a test assertion message.

## Review Focus

The spec implies five failure modes that none of its test bullets exercise and that would most likely bite a user. Each gets a test in the task that owns the code.

1. **A token unplugged (or never touched) in the middle of a refresh.** `ssh-keygen -Y sign` blocks on the touch or fails; a run must not publish a catalogue that lists a signer which did not sign, must not leave the old catalogue unservable, and must say which key skipped and why. Owner: Task 2 (`test_an_unplugged_key_is_dropped_and_the_others_sign`, `test_when_no_key_can_sign_the_served_pair_is_untouched`, `test_a_signer_that_times_out_is_unavailable_not_a_hang`).
2. **Disk full while writing the catalogue and its signatures.** A half-written pair is a catalogue every laptop refuses. All new files are staged first and renamed into place; an `ENOSPC` anywhere before the renames leaves the served pair byte-identical. Owner: Task 2 (`test_disk_full_while_staging_leaves_the_served_pair_untouched`); the same rule for a full drive in Task 8 (`test_a_full_drive_leaves_no_catalogue_behind`).
3. **A retired key still listed.** A retired key left in `signers`, or its `<n>.sig` left in `catalogue.sig.d/`, is a key the operator believes is dead still vouching. Owner: Task 2 (`test_a_retired_key_is_gone_from_signers_and_the_signature_directory`) and Task 3 (`test_retire_republishes_at_once_and_refuses_the_last_key`, `test_a_retire_that_could_not_publish_is_finished_by_the_next_publish`).
4. **Two things writing at once**: a second run, `bunker keys retire`, `bunker enrol remove` or `bunker export` landing while a run is publishing, and a laptop reading while a run is mid-way. Owner: Task 2 (`test_a_second_publish_is_refused_while_one_holds_the_lock`, `test_the_served_pair_does_not_change_until_the_run_publishes`), Task 3 (`test_keys_retire_during_a_run_is_locked_out_and_changes_nothing`), Task 8 (`test_export_is_locked_out_by_a_run`).
5. **The serial going backwards.** Laptops refuse a lower serial, so a Bunker that loses `catalogue.json` (a restore from backup, an operator moving it aside) and restarts at 1 locks the whole fleet out until each runs `hammunition mirror accept-older`. The serial is kept in its own high-water file. Owner: Task 1 (`test_the_serial_never_goes_backwards_when_the_catalogue_is_lost`).

---

### Task 1: Catalogue v3 — the index becomes `catalogue.json`

The index document gains `serial`, `bunker`, `signers`, `inputs` and, per artifact, `publisher_name`, `publisher_size` and `share`; `index.json` is renamed `catalogue.json`; a v2 `index.json` is still read and upgraded. A run no longer rewrites the served file after every artifact: it keeps its working state in `.state.json` and publishes `catalogue.json` once, at the end, through the new `bunker.publish` (unsigned until Task 2). The serial lives in its own `.serial` high-water file.

**Files:**
- Create: `src/bunker/publish.py`, `tests/plan_a.py`, `tests/test_publish.py`
- Modify: `src/bunker/index.py` (whole file, 1-262), `src/bunker/config.py` (`__all__` 22-38, `_KNOWN` 51-58, `Config` 128-135, `load` 284-320), `src/bunker/enginelib.py` (after 67), `src/bunker/run.py` (imports 36-52, `_finish` 651-670), `src/bunker/verify.py` (imports 20-27, 127-129), `src/bunker/cli.py` (imports 272-276, `cmd_serve` 175, `cmd_schedule` 190-191), `src/bunker/server.py` (docstring 1-22, `Routes` 55-99, 207), `src/bunker/volume.py` (docstring 15, `RESERVED` 58), `src/bunker/statuspage.py` (208-211), `fuzz/fuzz_index_status.py` (62-93), `fuzz/fuzz_server_paths.py` (29), `docs/reference.md` (The volume 156-174, The index 176-205, HTTP 207-222, Configuration table 49-78), `docs/guide.md` (212-213, 258, 305), `config.example.toml` (after the `[engine]` table), `CHANGELOG.md` (Unreleased, `### Added` at line 17)
- Test: `tests/test_index.py` (edits at lines 51, 55, 67, 83-84, 90, 104-106, 117-129, 139-144, 169), `tests/test_config.py`, `tests/test_publish.py`, `tests/test_run.py` (47-48), `tests/test_server.py` (169-194), `tests/test_kinds.py` (319), `tests/test_volume.py` (41), `tests/conftest.py`, `tests/helpers.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `bunker.volume.write_atomic(path: Path, data: bytes) -> None`; `bunker.config` (`Config`, `ConfigError`, `_choice`); `hammunition.catalogue.parse(raw: bytes) -> Catalogue` in tests and in `enginelib.validate_catalogue` (Plan A Task 1), which raises `CatalogueError(ValueError)` naming the offending field (`signers`, `artifacts[0].share`, ...) and refuses, among other things, a signer whose `id`, `algorithm` or `bits` is not what `classify(public_key)` says, a `publisher_name` without a `publisher_size` (or the reverse, or a size of zero), an input whose `path` is not `inputs/<kind>/<name>`, and duplicate `(kind, region)` inputs.
- Produces (all in `bunker.index` unless noted):
  - `INDEX_VERSION: int = 3`, `FILE = "catalogue.json"`, `LEGACY_FILE = "index.json"`, `STATE = ".state.json"`, `SERIAL_FILE = ".serial"`, `INPUT_KINDS: tuple[str, ...]`
  - `@dataclass(frozen=True) class Signer: id: str; public_key: str; algorithm: str; bits: int; hardware: bool; signature: str; no_touch_required: bool = False`
  - `@dataclass class Input: kind: str; region: str; name: str; path: str; sha256: str; size: int; fetched: str`
  - `Entry` gains `publisher_name: str | None = None`, `publisher_size: int | None = None`, `share: str = "all"`
  - `Index` gains `serial: int = 0`, `name: str = "bunker"`, `mode: str = "personal"`, `signers: list[dict[str, Any]]`, `inputs: list[Input]`
  - `body(idx: Index, *, serial: int, generated: str, signers: Sequence[Mapping[str, Any]] | None = None) -> dict[str, Any]`
  - `render(idx: Index, *, serial: int, generated: str, signers: Sequence[Mapping[str, Any]] | None = None) -> bytes`
  - `save(root: Path, idx: Index, *, generated: str) -> None` (writes `.state.json`, unsigned, never served)
  - `next_serial(root: Path, published: int) -> int`
  - `load(root: Path) -> Index` (reads `.state.json`, else `catalogue.json`, else `index.json`)
  - `bunker.config.MODES: tuple[str, ...]`, `BunkerConfig(name: str, mode: str)`, `Config.bunker: BunkerConfig`
  - `bunker.publish.PublishResult(published: bool, serial: int, signed_by: tuple[str, ...] = (), skipped: tuple[tuple[str, str], ...] = ())`, `publish(cfg: Config, idx: Index, *, generated: str) -> PublishResult`, `ensure_published(cfg: Config, *, generated: str) -> None`
  - `bunker.enginelib.catalogue_module() -> ModuleType`, `bunker.enginelib.validate_catalogue(data: bytes) -> None`
  - `tests.plan_a.module(name) -> ModuleType`, `optional(name) -> ModuleType | None`, `parse_catalogue(data: bytes) -> Any`, `catalogue_error() -> type[Exception]`, `REQUIRE_PLAN_A: bool`
  - `tests.helpers.FAKE_PUBLIC`, `FAKE_ID`, `FAKE_SK_PUBLIC`, `FAKE_SK_ID`

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_index.py -q` — Expected: passes (nothing changed yet).

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing index tests**

In `tests/test_index.py` change the imports and add tests. Replace lines 10-13 with:

```python
import pytest

from bunker import index
from bunker.index import Entry, Index, IndexRefused, Input, Signer
from tests import plan_a
from tests.helpers import FAKE_ID, FAKE_PUBLIC
```

Add after `an_entry` (line 34):

```python
def an_input(**over: Any) -> Input:
    fields: dict[str, Any] = {
        "kind": "region-outline",
        "region": "europe/monaco",
        "name": "europe/monaco.poly",
        "path": "inputs/region-outline/europe/monaco.poly",
        "sha256": "c" * 64,
        "size": 2048,
        "fetched": "2026-10-06T03:00:00Z",
    }
    fields.update(over)
    return Input(**fields)


SIGNER = Signer(
    id=FAKE_ID,
    public_key=FAKE_PUBLIC,
    algorithm="ssh-ed25519",
    bits=256,
    hardware=False,
    signature="catalogue.sig.d/1.sig",
)


def v2_document() -> dict[str, Any]:
    entry = {
        k: v
        for k, v in asdict(an_entry()).items()
        if k not in ("publisher_name", "publisher_size", "share")
    }
    return {
        "kind": "bunker-index",
        "version": 2,
        "generated": "2026-10-04T00:00:00Z",
        "engine": {"version": "0.21.0"},
        "artifacts": [entry],
        "deferred": [],
        "declined": [],
        "last_run": None,
    }
```

and add `from dataclasses import asdict` to the imports. Apply these edits to the existing tests (the working file is now `.state.json`; `index.json` is only ever read for an upgrade):

| Line | Change |
|---|---|
| 51 | `(tmp_path / "index.json")` becomes `(tmp_path / index.STATE)` |
| 53 | `assert raw["version"] == 2` becomes `assert raw["version"] == 3` |
| 55 | `assert raw["engine"] == {"version": "0.21.0"}` becomes `assert raw["engine_version"] == "0.21.0" and "engine" not in raw` |
| 67 | `== ["index.json"]` becomes `== [index.STATE]` |
| 83-84 | both `"index.json"` become `index.STATE` |
| 90 | `"version": 3` becomes `"version": 4` (a legacy file newer than this Bunker still refuses) |
| 104-106 | the v0 chain: the last assertion reads `json.loads((tmp_path / index.STATE).read_text())["version"] == 3` |
| 117, 129 | `path = tmp_path / "index.json"` becomes `path = tmp_path / index.STATE`; `assert upgraded["version"] == 2 and upgraded["declined"] == []` becomes `== 3` |
| 141-144 | `ensure` moves to `publish.ensure_published` (Step 8); delete `test_ensure_writes_an_empty_index_only_when_absent` here |
| 169 | `"engine": {"version": "0.21.0"}` stays (a v3 file written before this change is read through the same fallback); add `"serial": 1, "signers": [], "inputs": []` to the dict |

Add the new tests at the end of the file:

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_index.py -q -x`
Expected: FAIL at import — `ImportError: cannot import name 'Input' from 'bunker.index'`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the failing `[bunker]` config tests**

Append to `tests/test_config.py`:

```python
def test_the_bunker_table_defaults_and_values(tmp_path: Path) -> None:
    assert config.load(write(tmp_path, "")).bunker == config.BunkerConfig("bunker", "personal")
    cfg = config.load(write(tmp_path, '[bunker]\nname = "shack-1"\nmode = "group"\n'))
    assert (cfg.bunker.name, cfg.bunker.mode) == ("shack-1", "group")

        ('[bunker]\nname = ""\n', "bunker.name"),
        ('[bunker]\nname = "-x"\n', "bunker.name"),
        (f'[bunker]\nname = "{"a" * 64}"\n', "bunker.name"),
        ('[bunker]\nmode = "club"\n', "bunker.mode"),
        ("[bunker]\nport = 1\n", "unknown key bunker.port"),
    ],

def test_a_bad_bunker_table_is_refused_by_key(tmp_path: Path, text: str, needle: str) -> None:
    with pytest.raises(ConfigError, match=needle):
        config.load(write(tmp_path, text))
```

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_config.py -q -k bunker`
Expected: FAIL — `AttributeError: module 'bunker.config' has no attribute 'BunkerConfig'`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Add `[bunker]` to `src/bunker/config.py`**

Add `"MODES"`, `"BunkerConfig"` to `__all__` (keep it sorted). After line 49 (`DEFAULT_PATHS`) add:

```python
#: ``personal``: one operator's machines. ``group``: several operators, one admin;
#: the Bunker filters ``owner:`` entries by enrolment (docs/reference.md).
MODES = ("personal", "group")
```

In `_KNOWN` (line 51) add `"bunker": ("name", "mode"),` as the first entry. After `Serve` (line 126) add:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class BunkerConfig:
    name: str = "bunker"
    """The signing principal is ``bunker:<name>``: lowercase letters, digits and hyphens."""
    mode: str = "personal"


_NAME = re.compile(r"[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,62}")
```

Add `bunker: BunkerConfig` to `Config` (after `serve: Serve`, before `path: Path`), add this function above `load`:

```python
def _bunker(table: Mapping[str, Any]) -> BunkerConfig:
    name = table.get("name", "bunker")
    if not isinstance(name, str) or not _NAME.fullmatch(name):
        raise ConfigError(
            f"bunker.name is {name!r}; use 1 to 63 lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, "
            f"starting with a letter or digit"
        )
    return BunkerConfig(name=name, mode=_choice(table.get("mode", "personal"), "bunker.mode", MODES))
```

and in `load`'s `return Config(` pass `bunker=_bunker(_table(data, "bunker")),` before `path=path`.

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_config.py -q`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 6: Replace `src/bunker/index.py`**

"""``catalogue.json``: the Bunker's own document, versioned, one per volume.

Three files carry it. ``catalogue.json`` is the published one: it is what the
server maps ``<unit>/<name>`` through, what the signatures cover and what a
laptop reads, and it changes only when :mod:`bunker.publish` writes it.
``.state.json`` is the Bunker's working copy, the same document unsigned,
rewritten after every artifact so a killed run loses nothing; it is never
served. ``index.json`` is the version-2 name, still read for one release so a
volume written by an older Bunker upgrades in place, and never deleted:
deleting is for a person.

``serial`` only grows. It lives in ``.serial`` as well as in the document so a
volume restored without its catalogue does not start again at 1, which every
laptop would refuse.

The document is never the proof of anything: every file it names has a
sidecar, and the bytes are re-hashed against the sidecar on a cadence. An
older document is upgraded on load; a newer one refuses, because a Bunker
cannot know what fields it would be dropping.

Add to `src/bunker/enginelib.py` after line 67 (and add `"catalogue_module"`, `"validate_catalogue"` to `__all__`):

```python

- [ ] **Step 9: Wire the run, verify and the CLI to `publish`**

`src/bunker/run.py`: change line 36 to `from bunker import publish, statuspage`. In `_finish` (lines 651-670) replace the `save_index(root, idx, generated=report.finished)` line with:

```python
    save_index(root, idx, generated=report.finished)
    publish.publish(cfg, idx, generated=report.finished)

(The first line stays: the working state is saved before anything can fail.)

`src/bunker/verify.py`: change line 20 to `from bunker import publish, statuspage` and replace lines 128-129 with:

```python
        save_index(root, idx, generated=report.finished)
        publish.publish(cfg, idx, generated=report.finished)
        statuspage.write(root, idx)
```

`src/bunker/cli.py`: change the import on line 272 to add `publish` (`from bunker import __version__, checks, config, envelope, index, publish, run, schedule, server, verify`). In `cmd_serve` and `cmd_schedule` replace `index.ensure(cfg.storage.root, generated=_now_iso())` and `index.ensure(root, generated=_now_iso())` with `publish.ensure_published(cfg, generated=_now_iso())` (keep the `index.load(...)` that follows each).

- [ ] **Step 10: The server reads `catalogue.json`, and answers `index.json` as an alias**

In `src/bunker/server.py` replace `Routes` (lines 55-99) with:

```python
CATALOGUE = "catalogue.json"
LEGACY = "index.json"


class Routes:
    """Request path -> file, rebuilt whenever the catalogue changes. The

Change line 207 to `if target.path in ("catalogue.json", "index.json", "status.html"):` and the module docstring's first paragraph (lines 6-8) to say "through ``catalogue.json``". In `src/bunker/volume.py` change line 58 to `RESERVED = ("index.json", "catalogue.json", "status.html")` and the docstring line 15 to `catalogue.json  status.html     what is served as navigation (index.json: the v2 name, read for one release)`. In `src/bunker/statuspage.py` lines 208-211 change `index.json` to `catalogue.json` (both the href and the text).

- [ ] **Step 11: Update the existing tests that name the file**

Apply with exact edits:

- `tests/test_run.py` lines 47-48 become:
  ```python
      raw = json.loads((scene.root / "catalogue.json").read_text())
      assert raw["engine_version"] == "0.21.0"

  ```

  ```python
      for name in (FILE, STATE):  # the index moved aside: the published copy and the working copy
          (bench.root / name).unlink()
  ```
  and add `from bunker.index import FILE, STATE` beside line 31.
- `tests/test_volume.py` line 41: add `("catalogue.json", "x"),` under `("index.json", "x"),`.
- `fuzz/fuzz_server_paths.py` line 29: `_ROOT / "index.json"` becomes `_ROOT / "catalogue.json"`. `fuzz/fuzz_index_status.py`: in `_entry` add after `"previous": _val(fdp, None),` the three lines `"publisher_name": _val(fdp, None), "publisher_size": _val(fdp, None), "share": _val(fdp, "all"),`; in `_document` replace the `"engine": ...` line with `"engine_version": _val(fdp, "0.0.1"),` and add `"serial": _val(fdp, 1), "bunker": _val(fdp, {"name": "bunker", "mode": "personal"}), "signers": _val(fdp, []), "inputs": _val(fdp, []),`; change `version = index.INDEX_VERSION if ...` unchanged; line 90 `_ROOT / "index.json"` becomes `_ROOT / index.FILE`.

Expected: `exit=0`. If `tests/test_cli.py::test_*golden` fails on a changed document, the cause is a real change (read the diff); `status.json`/`run.json` do not change in this task.

- [ ] **Step 14: Docs, changelog, falsification, `make check`, commit**

`docs/reference.md`: in the Configuration table add after the `engine.timeout` row:

```
| `bunker.name` | `"bunker"` | the name this Bunker signs as: the signing principal is `bunker:<name>`. 1 to 63 lowercase letters, digits and hyphens |
| `bunker.mode` | `"personal"` | `personal` (one operator's machines) or `group` (several operators, one admin; Task 6's `share` filter) |
```

Replace the `## The volume` tree (lines 158-168) with one that lists `catalogue.json` (the published catalogue), `.state.json` (the working copy), `.serial` (the highest serial ever used) and `index.json` (the v2 name, read once and never deleted); replace `## The index` (lines 176-205) with `## The catalogue`: "`catalogue.json`, version 3", a field table with `kind`, `version` (3; an index of version 1 or 2 is upgraded in place on load, a newer one refused), `serial`, `generated`, `bunker.name`, `bunker.mode`, `signers`, `engine_version`, `artifacts`, `inputs`, `deferred`, `declined`, `last_run`, the artifact table of the old section plus `publisher_name`, `publisher_size` and `share`, and a paragraph: "Three files carry it. `catalogue.json` is published once at the end of a run, a `verify`, a key or enrolment change; `.state.json` is the working copy a run rewrites after every artifact and nobody is served; `index.json` is the old name, answered as an alias for one release." In the HTTP table add `/catalogue.json` and change `/index.json` to "the catalogue (alias of `/catalogue.json`, for one release)". In `docs/guide.md` change the three `index.json` mentions (lines 212, 258, 305) to `catalogue.json` and the link anchor to `reference.md#the-catalogue`. `CHANGELOG.md`, first `### Added` under Unreleased: "- Catalogue version 3: `index.json` becomes `catalogue.json` with `serial`, `bunker`, `signers`, `inputs` and per-artifact `publisher_name`, `publisher_size` and `share`; a version-2 `index.json` upgrades in place; the working copy is `.state.json`, published once per run through `bunker.publish`; `[bunker]` config (`name`, `mode`). The serial is kept in `.serial` so a lost catalogue cannot lower it."

Falsify once: in `index.next_serial` temporarily change `max(high, published, 0) + 1` to `max(published, 0) + 1`, run `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_index.py -q -k serial` — Expected: `test_the_serial_never_goes_backwards_when_the_catalogue_is_lost` FAILS (`assert 1 == 3`); restore it.

Run: `make check; echo "exit=$?"` — Expected: `exit=0`.

```

### Task 2: Signing — backends, one signature per key, atomic publication

`bunker.signing` signs the exact bytes of `catalogue.json` with `ssh-keygen -Y sign -n hammunition-bunker-catalogue`, once per configured key, for three backends (`file`, `security-key`, `agent`) that differ only in what `-f` points at and what the process can reach. `publish_signed` is the one place the served pair (`catalogue.json`, `catalogue.sig.d/<n>.sig`) changes: stage everything, verify every signature locally, validate with the engine's reader, then rename into place. A fake-backend seam lets every other test publish without a token or `ssh-keygen`; tests that exercise the real thing generate real file keys with `ssh-keygen` in `tmp_path` and are marked `real_signing`.

**Files:**
- Create: `src/bunker/signing.py`, `tests/signing_fakes.py`, `tests/realkeys.py`, `tests/test_signing.py`
- Modify: `src/bunker/publish.py` (whole body, 1-52 as written in Task 1), `src/bunker/index.py` (add `parse_stamp`; imports 31-36), `src/bunker/volume.py` (`RunLock.__init__` 548-553), `src/bunker/run.py` (`_parse` 93-99, `RunReport` 137-217, `_finish` 651-670), `src/bunker/verify.py` (`VerifyReport` 41-65, tail 127-130), `src/bunker/cli.py` (`_dispatch` 529-540), `tests/conftest.py`, `tests/test_publish.py`, `tests/test_cli.py` (`test_schedule_serves_runs_and_stops_on_sigterm` 202-238), `tests/test_run.py`, `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.pytest.ini_options]`), `docs/reference.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`

"""Signing the catalogue.

``catalogue.json`` is signed as the exact bytes served, with
``ssh-keygen -Y sign -n hammunition-bunker-catalogue``, once per configured
key. The three backends differ only in what ``-f`` names and what the process
can reach: ``file`` (a private key in ``<root>/.keys``), ``security-key`` (the
key handle of a FIDO2 ``-sk`` key; the token must be attached and, unless the
key was made ``no-touch-required``, touched) and ``agent`` (a public key file
with no private key beside it: ``ssh-keygen`` then asks ``ssh-agent``, which is
how PIV and other PKCS#11 tokens sign).

:func:`publish_signed` is the only place the served pair changes. It stages
every file first, so a full disk or a pulled token before the renames leaves
the previous catalogue and its signatures exactly as they were. Every
signature is verified locally before anything is published, and the engine's
own reader must accept the document: the Bunker never publishes what a laptop
would refuse.

`tests/test_cli.py::test_schedule_serves_runs_and_stops_on_sigterm`: the scheduler is a separate process the fake backend cannot reach, so give it a real key: add `@pytest.mark.real_signing` above the test and, after `scene.cfg()`, `realkeys.make_file_key(scene.root, "ed25519")` (import `from tests import realkeys`). Update the goldens (`BUNKER_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py -q`) and read the diff: only `run.json` gains `"catalogue"` and `verify.json` gains `"error": null`.

(imports: `from pathlib import Path`, `from typing import Any`, `import pytest`, `from bunker import run as run_module`, `from tests.helpers import FAKE_ID`, `from tests.signing_fakes import FakeBackend`; the file's existing imports cover the rest.)

- [ ] **Step 7: Run everything**

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -W error::DeprecationWarning; echo "exit=$?"`
Expected: `exit=0` (Plan A parse tests skip without the Plan A checkout). If `test_a_run_whose_catalogue_could_not_be_signed...` fails with `catalogue.json` existing, the first-run `ensure` is publishing: it is not called by `run`, so check `publish.publish` is the only writer.

- [ ] **Step 8: Docs, falsification, changelog, commit**

`docs/reference.md`: in *The volume* tree add `catalogue.sig.d/<n>.sig` (one signature per key that signed, numbered from 1 in `signers` order), `.keys/` (0700: `keys.json` the registry, the key files, `signed.json` when each key last signed), `.serial`, `.publish.lock`; add a `## Signing` section: the namespace, the principal `bunker:<name>`, "the signed bytes are exactly `catalogue.json` as served", how to check by hand:

```
ssh-keygen -Y verify -f allowed_signers -I bunker:<name> -n hammunition-bunker-catalogue \
    -s catalogue.sig.d/1.sig < catalogue.json
```

the three backends, "a key that cannot sign (a token not attached, not touched within 60 s) is left out of `signers` for that publication and named in the run's warnings; if none can sign, nothing is published and the previous catalogue keeps serving", "a run signs once, at its end; a catalogue is signed again only when its content changed, a key was added or retired, or it is seven days old", and "an `allowed_signers` line takes `namespaces`, never `no-touch-required` (OpenSSH 10.3 rejects it); user presence is a property of the key's creation, not of the verifying line". Add `catalogue` to the `run` document's field list and `error` to the `verify` document's. `CHANGELOG.md` first `### Added`: "- Signing: `bunker.signing` signs `catalogue.json` with `ssh-keygen -Y sign` (namespace `hammunition-bunker-catalogue`) once per key into `catalogue.sig.d/<n>.sig`, for file, security-key and agent keys; staged, verified locally and renamed into place, so a pulled token or a full disk leaves the previous pair serving."

Falsify twice. (1) In `publish_signed` swap the two `os.replace` blocks' arguments so the catalogue is replaced before the signatures are, run `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_publish.py -q` and see `test_one_signature_per_key_and_the_catalogue_names_them` still pass (order is not asserted by content) — then instead delete the `shutil.rmtree(staging, ignore_errors=True)` in the `except OSError` branch and see `test_disk_full_while_staging_leaves_the_served_pair_untouched` FAIL on `assert not (tmp_path / signing.STAGING).exists()`; restore. (2) Change `names = {f"{n}.sig" ...}` cleanup to skip the stale-removal loop and see `test_a_retired_key_is_gone_from_signers_and_the_signature_directory` FAIL (`['1.sig', '2.sig'] != ['1.sig']`); restore.

Run: `make check; echo "exit=$?"` — Expected: `exit=0`.

```bash
git add src/bunker/signing.py src/bunker/publish.py src/bunker/index.py src/bunker/volume.py src/bunker/run.py src/bunker/verify.py src/bunker/cli.py tests/signing_fakes.py tests/realkeys.py tests/test_signing.py tests/test_publish.py tests/test_run.py tests/test_cli.py tests/conftest.py tests/golden pyproject.toml docs/reference.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Sign the catalogue: ssh-keygen -Y sign per key, staged and renamed into place

File, security-key and agent backends behind one seam; a key that cannot sign is
left out and named, not retried in a hang; a full disk or a pulled token leaves
the previous catalogue and signatures serving; a catalogue is signed only when
it changed, a key changed, or it is a week old."
```

### Task 3: Key management — `[signing]`, `bunker keys`, first-run setup, key strength

`bunker keys list|add|retire` manage the registry Task 2 reads; a first start with no keys detects a FIDO2 token (`fido2-token -L`) and a PIV card (`opensc-tool --list-readers`, through `pcscd`), offers hardware as the recommended default, and otherwise explains why a hardware key is worth having and makes a file key. Generation order is Ed25519, ECDSA, RSA 4096, RSA 3072, RSA 2048; every key is classified by the engine's `hammunition.keystrength` and RSA of 2048 bits or fewer is warned wherever it is shown. Adding or retiring a key republishes the catalogue at once.

**Files:**
- Create: `src/bunker/keys.py`, `tests/test_keys.py`, `tests/golden/keys.json` (written by the golden helper)
- Modify: `src/bunker/config.py` (`__all__` 22-38, `_KNOWN` 51-58, `_engine` 210-233, `Config` 128-135, `load` 284-320), `src/bunker/enginelib.py` (after `validate_catalogue`), `src/bunker/signing.py` (`PublishFailed`'s base stays; no change), `src/bunker/publish.py`, `src/bunker/cli.py` (imports 272-276, `_now_iso` 415-416, `cmd_run` 296-303, `cmd_serve` 419-431, `cmd_schedule` 434-474, `COMMANDS` 477-485, `parser` 488-526, `_dispatch` 529-540), `src/bunker/doctor.py` (imports 20-24, `doctor` 158-161), `Dockerfile` (apt list 34-38), `config.example.toml`, `docs/reference.md`, `docs/guide.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (Layout), `CHANGELOG.md`, `tests/test_config.py`, `tests/test_doctor.py` (36-39), `tests/test_cli.py`, `tests/test_packaging.py`, `tests/realkeys.py` (unchanged), `tests/golden/doctor.json`
- Test: `tests/test_keys.py` (real `ssh-keygen`, stub runners for tokens), `tests/test_config.py`, `tests/test_doctor.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`, `tests/test_packaging.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `bunker.signing` (`KeySpec`, `load_registry`, `save_registry`, `load_signed`, `keys_dir`, `fingerprint`, `clean_public_key`, `run_command`, `Runner`, `SigningError`, `PublishFailed`, `BACKEND_NAMES`), `bunker.publish.publish`, `bunker.volume.RunLock`, `hammunition.keystrength.classify(public_key_line: str) -> KeyStrength(algorithm, bits, hardware_by_type, rank, weak, warning, fingerprint)` (Plan A Task 1): `warning` is `None` unless the key is weak and is then exactly `RSA <bits>-bit is weak: replace with Ed25519, ECDSA or RSA 3072+`; it raises `ValueError` for DSA, a blob whose embedded type is not the line's, a key `ssh-keygen -l` refuses, or a missing `ssh-keygen` (it runs `ssh-keygen -l -E sha256 -f /dev/stdin`); `fingerprint` is the SHA256 form `ssh-keygen -l` prints.
- Produces:
  - `bunker.config.SigningConfig(refresh_days: int = 7, sign_timeout: float = 60.0, ssh_keygen: tuple[str, ...] = ("ssh-keygen",), agent_socket: str | None = None)`, `Config.signing`

  - CLI: `bunker keys list [--json]`, `bunker keys add [--backend {file,security-key,agent}] [--algorithm ALG] [--no-touch] [--public-key PATH] [--hardware]`, `bunker keys retire REF`; the `keys` document (`serial`, `hardware_key`, `keys[]`); `bunker.doctor.which` seam; a `signing` doctor check.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing config tests**

Append to `tests/test_config.py`:

```python
def test_the_signing_table_defaults_and_values(tmp_path: Path) -> None:
    assert config.load(write(tmp_path, "")).signing == config.SigningConfig()
    cfg = config.load(
        write(
            tmp_path,
            '[signing]\nrefresh_days = 14\nsign_timeout = 120\nssh_keygen = "/opt/ssh/ssh-keygen"\n'
            'agent_socket = "/run/agent.sock"\n',
        )
    )
    assert cfg.signing == config.SigningConfig(14, 120.0, ("/opt/ssh/ssh-keygen",), "/run/agent.sock")


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    ("text", "needle"),
    [
        ("[signing]\nrefresh_days = 0\n", "signing.refresh_days"),
        ("[signing]\nrefresh_days = 91\n", "signing.refresh_days"),
        ('[signing]\nrefresh_days = "7"\n', "signing.refresh_days"),
        ("[signing]\nsign_timeout = 0\n", "signing.sign_timeout"),
        ("[signing]\nsign_timeout = 601\n", "signing.sign_timeout"),
        ('[signing]\nssh_keygen = ""\n', "signing.ssh_keygen"),
        ("[signing]\nagent_socket = 5\n", "signing.agent_socket"),
        ("[signing]\nkey = 1\n", "unknown key signing.key"),
    ],
)
def test_a_bad_signing_table_is_refused_by_key(tmp_path: Path, text: str, needle: str) -> None:
    with pytest.raises(ConfigError, match=needle):
        config.load(write(tmp_path, text))
```

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_config.py -q -k signing` — Expected: FAIL, `AttributeError: module 'bunker.config' has no attribute 'SigningConfig'`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add `[signing]` to `src/bunker/config.py`**

Add `"SigningConfig"` to `__all__` (isort order). In `_KNOWN` add `"signing": ("refresh_days", "sign_timeout", "ssh_keygen", "agent_socket"),` after `"serve"`. Add after `BunkerConfig`:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SigningConfig:
    refresh_days: int = 7
    """A catalogue this old is signed again even if nothing changed."""
    sign_timeout: float = 60.0
    """Seconds one signature may take: a security key waits this long for a touch."""
    ssh_keygen: tuple[str, ...] = ("ssh-keygen",)
    agent_socket: str | None = None
    """``SSH_AUTH_SOCK`` for ``agent`` keys; unset uses the process's own."""
```

Add `signing: SigningConfig` to `Config` (after `bunker`). Replace the command parsing at the top of `_engine` (lines 211-222) by a shared helper and use it in both:

```python
def _command(raw: Any, key: str) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if isinstance(raw, str):
        try:
            command = tuple(shlex.split(raw))
        except ValueError:  # an unclosed quotation
            command = ()
    elif isinstance(raw, list) and all(isinstance(p, str) for p in raw):
        command = tuple(raw)
    else:
        command = ()
    if not command or not all(command):

In `_engine`, replace the `raw = ...` through `raise ConfigError("engine.command must be ...")` block with `command = _command(table.get("command", "hammunition"), "engine.command")`. In `load`'s `return Config(` add `signing=_signing(_table(data, "signing")),`.

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_config.py -q` — Expected: PASS (the existing `engine.command` tests still match "engine.command").

- [ ] **Step 5: Wire the commands**

`src/bunker/cli.py`:

Imports (line 272): `from bunker import __version__, checks, config, envelope, index, keys, publish, run, schedule, server, signing, verify`, and `from dataclasses import asdict` plus `from bunker.volume import Locked, RunLock`.

Replace `_now_iso` (415-416):

```python
def _now_iso() -> str:
    return run.iso(CLOCK() if CLOCK is not None else datetime.now(UTC))
```

Add after `_now_iso`:

```python
def _prepare(cfg: Config, *, publish_empty: bool) -> None:
    """Keys exist before anything is signed: a first start makes them (asking, on
    a terminal; otherwise a file key). A server also publishes an empty signed
    catalogue so the healthcheck and a laptop have something to read at once."""
    interactive = sys.stdin.isatty() and sys.stdout.isatty()
    keys.ensure_keys(

        command=cfg.signing.ssh_keygen,
    )
    if publish_empty:
        publish.ensure_published(cfg, generated=_now_iso())
```

In `cmd_run` add `_prepare(cfg, publish_empty=False)` after `cfg = _config(args)`. In `cmd_serve` and `cmd_schedule` replace the `publish.ensure_published(cfg, generated=_now_iso())` line from Task 1 with `_prepare(cfg, publish_empty=True)`.

Add the command (above `COMMANDS`):

```python

Add `"keys": cmd_keys,` to `COMMANDS`. In `parser()` add (before `return top`):

```python

    keys_sub = p_keys.add_subparsers(dest="keys_command", required=True, metavar="ACTION")
    keys_sub.add_parser("list", parents=[common], help="every key, its strength and when it last signed")

    p_retire.add_argument("ref", metavar="FINGERPRINT", help="a fingerprint, or any unique prefix of six or more characters")
```

In `_dispatch` replace the Task 2 `except signing.PublishFailed` with `except signing.SigningError as exc:` (same body).

`src/bunker/publish.py`: replace the `publish` body with

```python
def publish(cfg: Config, idx: Index, *, generated: str) -> PublishResult:
    """Sign and publish *idx* when :func:`bunker.signing.publish_signed` says
    it needs publishing. Raises :class:`bunker.signing.PublishFailed`."""
    root = cfg.storage.root
    idx.name, idx.mode = cfg.bunker.name, cfg.bunker.mode
    return signing.publish_signed(
        root,
        idx,
        generated=generated,
        keys=signing.load_registry(root),
        backends=_backends(cfg),
        refresh=timedelta(days=cfg.signing.refresh_days),
        timeout=cfg.signing.sign_timeout,
        validate=enginelib.validate_catalogue,
    )


def _backends(cfg: Config) -> Mapping[str, signing.Backend]:
    if cfg.signing.ssh_keygen == ("ssh-keygen",) and cfg.signing.agent_socket is None:
        return signing.BACKENDS
    real = signing.SshKeygenBackend(cfg.signing.ssh_keygen, agent_socket=cfg.signing.agent_socket)
    return {name: real for name in signing.BACKEND_NAMES}
```

with `from collections.abc import Mapping` and `from datetime import timedelta`.

`src/bunker/doctor.py`: add `import shutil`, `from collections.abc import Callable`, `from bunker import ENGINE_FLOOR, keys, signing`, a seam and a check:

```python
#: ``shutil.which``; tests replace it so the suite does not depend on openssh-client.
which: Callable[[str], str | None] = shutil.which


def _signing(cfg: Config) -> Check:
    program = cfg.signing.ssh_keygen[0]
    if which(program) is None:
        return Check(
            "signing",
            False,
            f"{program!r} was not found: install openssh-client (the image has it); "
            f"the catalogue cannot be signed without it",
        )
    try:
        active = [k for k in signing.load_registry(cfg.storage.root) if k.retired is None]
    except signing.SigningError as exc:
        return Check("signing", False, str(exc))
    if not active:
        return Check("signing", False, "no signing key is configured: `bunker keys add` (a first start makes a file key)")
    detail = f"{len(active)} active key(s): " + ", ".join(f"{k.backend} {k.algorithm} {k.bits}-bit" for k in active)
    if not any(k.hardware for k in active):
        detail += "; no hardware key configured (recommended: `bunker keys add --backend security-key`)"
    for key in active:
        try:
            warning = keys.describe(key.public_key).warning
        except keys.KeyManagementError:
            warning = None
        if warning:
            detail += f"; {key.id}: {warning}"
    return Check("signing", True, detail)
```

and in `doctor()`: `report.checks += [_engine(cfg), _volume(cfg), _signing(cfg), _unverified(cfg), _port(cfg)]`.

Tests: in `tests/test_doctor.py` add an autouse fixture `monkeypatch.setattr(doctor, "which", lambda name: f"/usr/bin/{name}")` (module-level `@pytest.fixture(autouse=True) def _openssh(monkeypatch)`), change the check-name set on line 38 to include `"signing"`, and add `test_a_missing_ssh_keygen_fails_the_signing_check` (`monkeypatch.setattr(doctor, "which", lambda name: None)`; assert the check `not ok and "openssh-client" in detail`). In `tests/test_cli.py` add the same autouse `which` patch to the `invoke` fixture (`monkeypatch.setattr(doctor, "which", lambda name: "/usr/bin/" + name)`; `from bunker import doctor`), and:

```python
def test_keys_list_json_golden(invoke: Any, scene: Scene) -> None:
    plan_a.module("hammunition.keystrength")
    invoke("run")
    code, out, _ = invoke("keys", "list", "--json")
    assert code == 0
    assert_golden("keys", normalise(out, scene))
```

(`from tests import plan_a`). Regenerate: `BUNKER_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py -q`, read the diff of `doctor.json` (gains a `signing` check) and `keys.json` (the fake key, `in_catalogue: true`, `last_signed` the scene clock).

`Dockerfile`: change the apt list (lines 34-38) to add `openssh-client fido2-tools opensc libpcsclite1` and add `tests/test_packaging.py::test_the_image_has_the_signing_tools`:

```python
def test_the_image_has_the_signing_tools() -> None:
    text = (ROOT / "Dockerfile").read_text()
    for package in ("openssh-client", "fido2-tools", "opensc", "libpcsclite1"):
        assert re.search(rf"^\s+.*\b{package}\b", text, re.M), f"the image lacks {package}"
```

`config.example.toml`: add after `[bunker]`:

```toml
[signing]
refresh_days = 7           # sign again at this age even if nothing changed (1 to 90)
sign_timeout = 60          # seconds one signature may take; a security key waits for a touch (1 to 600)
ssh_keygen = "ssh-keygen"  # the program that signs
# agent_socket = "/run/agent.sock"   # SSH_AUTH_SOCK for agent (PIV) keys
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the suite**

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -W error::DeprecationWarning; echo "exit=$?"`
Expected: `exit=0`. The `plan_a`-gated tests skip without the Plan A checkout installed; on it they must all pass, so run the suite there before committing.

- [ ] **Step 7: Docs, falsification, `make check`, commit**

`docs/reference.md`: commands table rows for `bunker keys list`, `bunker keys add [--backend B] [--algorithm A] [--no-touch] [--public-key FILE] [--hardware]` and `bunker keys retire FINGERPRINT` (JSON kind `keys`); configuration rows for `signing.refresh_days`, `signing.sign_timeout`, `signing.ssh_keygen`, `signing.agent_socket`; a `keys` row in the `--json` documents table (`serial`, `hardware_key`, `keys` with `id`, `backend`, `algorithm`, `bits`, `hardware`, `retired`, `added`, `last_signed`, `in_catalogue`, `warning`); exit codes: `bunker keys add|retire` exits 2 when refused, 1 when the key list changed but the republish failed, 125 while a run holds the volume. `docs/guide.md`: a section "Signing keys" before "Security posture": what is signed and why (a laptop that enrols this Bunker accepts a catalogue only if one of the keys it was shown signed it), the first-start behaviour in a container (no terminal: a file key; `podman exec -it ... bunker keys add` to add a hardware key later), key order and the RSA-2048 warning, that `<root>/.keys` holds the private file keys (a copy of the volume is a copy of the key; a hardware key avoids that), and `bunker keys retire`. `CLAUDE.md` layout block: add `index, publish, signing, keys` to the `src/bunker/` list. `CHANGELOG.md`: "- Keys: `[signing]` config, `bunker keys list|add|retire`, a first-start setup that detects a FIDO2 token or PIV card and offers hardware as the default, file keys generated Ed25519, ECDSA, RSA 4096, RSA 3072, RSA 2048 with the engine's weak-key warning, a `signing` doctor check, and `openssh-client`, `fido2-tools`, `opensc` and `libpcsclite1` in the image."

Falsify: in `keys.retire` change `if len(active) == 1:` to `if len(active) == 0:`; run `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_keys.py -q -k retire` — Expected: `test_retire_matches_an_id_or_a_unique_prefix_and_keeps_the_files` FAILS (the last key is retired); restore. In `generate_file_key` swap `choice` handling so a named choice walks `ORDER`; `test_a_named_algorithm_is_made_and_never_downgraded` FAILS on `len(attempts) == 1`; restore.

Run: `make check; echo "exit=$?"` — Expected: `exit=0`.

```bash
git add src/bunker/keys.py src/bunker/config.py src/bunker/enginelib.py src/bunker/publish.py src/bunker/cli.py src/bunker/doctor.py Dockerfile config.example.toml CLAUDE.md docs/reference.md docs/guide.md CHANGELOG.md tests/test_keys.py tests/test_config.py tests/test_doctor.py tests/test_cli.py tests/test_packaging.py tests/golden
git commit -m "Key management: [signing], bunker keys, first-start setup, strength warnings

list/add/retire republish the catalogue at once and refuse to retire the last
key; a first start detects a FIDO2 token or PIV card and offers hardware, else
explains and makes a file key; generation walks Ed25519, ECDSA, RSA 4096/3072,
RSA 2048 and RSA of 2048 bits or fewer is warned using the engine's rule."
```

### Task 4: Record publisher facts and hold the engine's inputs

Two things the engine's offline planner reads from the catalogue. **Publisher facts**: for an artifact the repository does not pin by sha256, the dated file name and size the publisher reported. Plan A adds no field for them to `artifacts --json` (Task 16 keeps `ArtifactEntry` unchanged), and its reader (Tasks 1, 6, 8) wants exactly what the existing listing already carries, so the Bunker derives them: `publisher_name` is the last segment of the listed `url` (Geofabrik's dated `monaco-261006.osm.pbf`), `publisher_size` is the listed `size`, and the two are set together or both null (the reader refuses one without the other, and a size of zero or less). A `sha256`-pinned artifact gets neither (the pin is the trust). `publisher_url` is the listed `url` unchanged: the OSM resolver requires it to equal the dated URL it would build itself. **Inputs**: Plan A's `artifacts --json` (Task 16) gains a top-level `inputs` list of `{kind, region, name, url, sha256, size, content, deferred}`: the engine fetched the outline and built the four selection records itself with its own codecs (`render_record` of `RegionTiles`, `RegionQuads`, `RegionSheets`), and gives their exact UTF-8 text as `content` with its `sha256` and `size`. The Bunker writes `content` byte for byte under `inputs/<kind>/<name>`, checks the listed sha256 and size against what it is about to write, and records them. It has no codec of its own and fetches nothing for an input (the contract: "the Bunker never implements its own codec").

**Files:**
- Create: `src/bunker/inputs.py`
- Modify: `src/bunker/engine.py` (`__all__` 31-42, `Listing` 93-101, `_parse` 197-258), `src/bunker/run.py` (`RunReport` 137-217, matched branch 477-488, `commit` 530-538, `run()` 720-726), `src/bunker/volume.py` (`artifact_dir` 395-412, `RESERVED` 58, `__all__` 359-375), `fuzz/fuzz_engine_document.py` (28-55, 68-74), `tests/helpers.py` (`entry` 234-258, `artifacts_doc` 265-282), `tests/scene.py` (`Scene.list` 391-394), `tests/test_engine.py`, `tests/test_run.py`, `tests/test_volume.py` (41), `docs/reference.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Test: `tests/test_engine.py`, `tests/test_run.py`, `tests/test_volume.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `bunker.index.Input`, `bunker.index.INPUT_KINDS`, `bunker.volume.write_atomic`, `write_sidecar`, `file_name`; Plan A's `InputEntry` as the engine emits it.
- Produces:
  - `bunker.engine.InputSpec(kind: str, region: str, name: str, url: str | None, sha256: str, size: int, content: str)`; `Listing.inputs: tuple[InputSpec, ...] = ()`. An input the engine marks `deferred` is not an `InputSpec`: it becomes a `Deferred("inputs", "<kind>:<region>", reason)`.
  - `bunker.volume.input_path(root: Path, kind: str, name: str) -> Path`; `RESERVED` gains `catalogue.sig.d` and `inputs`
  - `bunker.inputs.InputOutcome(kind: str, region: str, name: str, action: str, reason: str | None = None)`; `hold_inputs(root: Path, idx: Index, wanted: Sequence[InputSpec], *, stamp: str) -> list[InputOutcome]`
  - `bunker.run._publisher_facts(artifact: Artifact) -> tuple[str | None, int | None]`; `RunReport.inputs: list[InputOutcome]`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

`tests/helpers.py`: add `import hashlib`; change `entry(...)` to take `**extra: Any` after `deferred` and return `{..., "deferred": deferred, **extra}`; change `artifacts_doc(...)` to take `inputs: list[dict[str, Any]] | None = None` and `git_pins: list[dict[str, Any]] | None = None` and, after building the dict in a variable, `if inputs is not None: doc["inputs"] = inputs` and `if git_pins is not None: doc["git_pins"] = git_pins`. Add (the shapes are Plan A Task 16's `InputEntry` and `GitPinEntry`):

```python
def input_item(
    kind: str,
    region: str,
    name: str,
    *,
    content: str | None = None,
    url: str | None = None,
    deferred: str | None = None,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """One ``InputEntry`` as the engine's ``artifacts --json`` emits it: the exact
    text, its sha256 and its size; all three null when the engine deferred it."""
    body = None if content is None else content.encode("utf-8")
    return {
        "kind": kind,
        "region": region,
        "name": name,
        "url": url,
        "sha256": None if body is None else hashlib.sha256(body).hexdigest(),
        "size": None if body is None else len(body),
        "content": content,
        "deferred": deferred,
    }


def git_pin_item(
    name: str,
    repo: str,
    ref: str,
    commit: str | None,
    *,
    submodules: bool = True,
    deferred: str | None = None,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """One ``GitPinEntry`` as the engine emits it (``unit`` is always ``git-bundles``)."""
    return {
        "unit": "git-bundles",
        "name": name,
        "repo": repo,
        "ref": ref,
        "commit": commit,
        "submodules": submodules,
        "deferred": deferred,
    }
```

`tests/scene.py` `Scene.list` becomes:

```python
    def list(
        self,
        entries: list[dict[str, Any]] | None = None,
        inputs: list[dict[str, Any]] | None = None,
        git_pins: list[dict[str, Any]] | None = None,
    ) -> None:
        self.engine.set_doc(
            artifacts_doc(
                entries if entries is not None else self.entries(),
                regions=(REGION,),
                inputs=inputs,

- [ ] **Step 2: The engine document**

`src/bunker/engine.py`: add `"InputSpec"` to `__all__` and

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class InputSpec:
    """A plan-time input the engine's planning needs, exactly as its
    ``artifacts --json`` lists it (Plan A, ``InputEntry``): the text to store,

    kind: str
    region: str
    name: str
    url: str | None
    sha256: str
    size: int
    content: str

Give `Listing` `inputs: tuple[InputSpec, ...] = ()` after `warnings`. Add `from bunker.index import INPUT_KINDS` and

    return tuple(specs), notes
```

In `_parse`, before the `return Listing(...)`: `inputs, input_notes = _inputs(doc)`, and pass `inputs=inputs` and `deferred=tuple(deferred) + tuple(input_notes)`. `fuzz/fuzz_engine_document.py`: in `_document` add `"inputs": [{"kind": _opt(fdp, "region-outline"), "region": _opt(fdp, "europe/monaco"), "name": _opt(fdp, "m.poly"), "url": _opt(fdp, "https://x"), "sha256": _opt(fdp, "0" * 64), "size": _opt(fdp, "5"), "content": _opt(fdp, "x\n"), "deferred": None if fdp.ConsumeBool() else _opt(fdp, "why")} for _ in range(fdp.ConsumeIntInRange(0, 3))]` and in `TestOneInput` after the deferred loop `for spec in listing.inputs: assert isinstance(spec.content, str) and isinstance(spec.size, int)`.

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_engine.py -q` — Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 3: Volume helpers**

In `src/bunker/volume.py` add `"input_path"` to `__all__`, set `RESERVED = ("index.json", "catalogue.json", "catalogue.sig.d", "status.html", "inputs")`, and replace `artifact_dir` (395-412):

The engine builds every input itself (it fetched the outline; it rendered the

and size in ``hammunition artifacts --json``. The Bunker writes that text byte

both. It has no codec of its own: a record the engine's reader would refuse is
the engine's to refuse, and the catalogue's signature only says "this Bunker

```

- [ ] **Step 5: The run records them**

`src/bunker/run.py`:

1. Imports: `from bunker import inputs, publish, signing, statuspage` and `from bunker.inputs import InputOutcome`.
2. After `Outcome` (line 135) add:

```python
def _publisher_facts(artifact: Artifact) -> tuple[str | None, int | None]:
    """What the publisher said, kept only for artifacts the repository does not
    pin by sha256 (for a pinned one the pin is the trust and the copy here only
    says "here"). The engine lists the dated URL and the size the publisher
    reported, so the name is the URL's last segment and the size the listed one;
    Plan A's reader wants the two together or neither, and a size above zero."""
    if artifact.check == "sha256" or artifact.size is None or artifact.size <= 0:
        return None, None
    return file_name(artifact.url), artifact.size
```

3. In the matched branch (lines 482-484) and in `commit` (533-535), after `entry.publisher_url = artifact.url` add `entry.publisher_name, entry.publisher_size = _publisher_facts(artifact)`.
4. `RunReport`: add `inputs: list[InputOutcome] = field(default_factory=list)`; `exit_code` adds `or any(o.action == "failed" for o in self.inputs)`; `as_dict` adds `"inputs": [asdict(o) for o in self.inputs],` before `"deferred"`; `summary_lines` appends, before the plain-HTTP block, `for o in self.inputs: if o.action == "failed": lines.append(f"  failed input: {o.kind} {o.region}/{o.name}: {o.reason}")`.
5. In `run()`, after the `ThreadPoolExecutor` block and before `_drop`:

```python
        if not units or "inputs" in units:
            report.inputs = inputs.hold_inputs(root, idx, got.inputs, stamp=state.stamp)
```

and add `known.add("inputs")` next to the other `known` lines so `--unit inputs` is legal. The engine's deferred inputs are already in `got.deferred`, hence in `report.deferred`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the suite**

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -W error::DeprecationWarning; echo "exit=$?"`
Expected: `exit=0`. Goldens: `BUNKER_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py -q`; `run.json` gains `"inputs": []`. Read the diff.

- [ ] **Step 7: Docs, falsification, commit**

`docs/reference.md`: the volume tree gains `inputs/<kind>/<name>` (+ `.sha256`); the catalogue artifact table gains `publisher_name` ("the last segment of the listed URL, the dated file name; null for an artifact the repository pins by sha256"), `publisher_size` ("the listed size; set with the name or both null"), and a catalogue `inputs` table (`kind` one of `region-outline`, `tile-selection`, `sheet-selection`, `dem3dep-selection`, `fstopo-selection`; `region`; `name`; `path` = `inputs/<kind>/<name>`; `sha256`; `size`; `fetched`) with the sentence "The text of an input is the engine's, byte for byte; the Bunker has no codec and fetches nothing for it"; "What the Bunker asks the engine" notes the `inputs` and `git_pins` arrays; the `run` document row gains `inputs` (`kind`, `region`, `name`, `action`, `reason`). `CHANGELOG.md`: "- Publisher facts and inputs: a run records `publisher_name` and `publisher_size` (from the listed URL and size) for artifacts the repository does not pin by sha256, and writes the inputs the engine lists (region outlines and the derived tile, sheet, 3DEP and FSTopo selections) byte for byte under `inputs/<kind>/<name>` with their sha256."

Falsify: in `_publisher_facts` delete the `artifact.check == "sha256"` clause; `test_publisher_facts_are_derived_for_publisher_digest_kinds_only` FAILS on the pinned `cty.dat`; restore. In `_one` skip the `digest != spec.sha256` comparison; `test_an_input_whose_listed_digest_is_not_its_content...` FAILS; restore.

Run: `make check; echo "exit=$?"` — Expected: `exit=0`.

```

### Task 5: Payloads, sheets and git bundles

What Plan A's `artifacts --json` (Task 16) now lists, and what the Bunker must do with each. **Software payloads** (source tarballs, prebuilt binaries, venv payloads, the Node tarball, the mapsforge converter tool, git extra files) are ordinary `sha256` artifacts named by the engine's `payload_name(pin)`, with a null size and the licence "licence not recorded in this manifest" (Plan A does not invent either): no new check kind, but the Bunker must cope with no size, and with names carrying `+`, `@` and nested paths through the engine's percent-quoting and the server. **Topo and FSTopo sheets**: US Topo and 3DEP are listed with `etag-md5` and the repository-carried ETag, which for a multipart upload is not an MD5 (`<hex>-<parts>`); `Fetcher.fetch_md5` cannot check that, `Fetcher.fetch_etag` (already in v0.21.0: single-part and multipart, `expected_size` required) can, so an `etag-md5` whose digest is not 32 hex goes there. FSTopo is `sha256` when the repository pins it and `unverified-fetch` (no digest, size and date only) when it does not, both kinds the Bunker already holds. **Git pins** are not in the `artifacts` array: Plan A lists them in a separate `git_pins` array (`GitPinEntry`: `unit` always `git-bundles`, `name`, `repo`, `ref`, `commit` or null, `submodules`, `deferred`), and says the Bunker enumerates the recursive gitlinks itself and lists every bundle. The Bunker builds each bundle: `git clone --no-checkout` of the repository, a check that the pinned commit (and, for a tag, the tag) is really there, `git bundle create --all`, and the same for each gitlink, under Plan A's `bundle_name`.

- Modify: `src/bunker/checks.py` (docstring 1-14, `KINDS` 420-489), `src/bunker/engine.py` (`Listing`, `_parse`), `src/bunker/enginelib.py` (after `keystrength_module`), `src/bunker/run.py` (`_download` 274-330, `sweep_incoming` 570-586, `_drop` 628-648, `RunReport` 137-217, `run()` 720-726), `Dockerfile` (apt list), `CLAUDE.md` (invariants), `README.md` (73-79, 124-126), `docs/reference.md` (102-111), `docs/guide.md` (295), `tests/test_kinds.py` (141-174), `tests/test_engine.py`, `tests/test_packaging.py`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Test: `tests/test_kinds.py`, `tests/test_engine.py`, `tests/test_gitbundle.py`, `tests/test_payloads.py`, `tests/test_packaging.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `Fetcher.fetch_etag(url: str, etag: str, *, expected_size: int)` and `Fetcher.fetch_md5` (both in v0.21.0); `hammunition.gitbundles.bundle_name(unit: str, commit: str, *, path: str | None = None, subcommit: str | None = None) -> str` (Plan A Task 15; raises `BackendError` on a malformed commit or path); `bunker.volume.install`, `hash_file`; `bunker.enginelib.BackendError`.
- Produces:
  - `bunker.checks.KINDS` gains `git-commit` (method `git_bundle`, no algorithm, needs a digest: the commit id). It is the Bunker's own kind for the rows `bunker.gitbundle` writes; no engine document carries it, so `tests/test_kinds.py::test_the_table_covers_every_kind_the_installed_engine_can_emit` is unaffected.
  - `bunker.engine.GitPin(name: str, repo: str, ref: str, commit: str, submodules: bool)`; `Listing.git_pins: tuple[GitPin, ...] = ()`. A pin the engine marks `deferred` (or with a null commit) is a `Deferred("git-bundles", name, reason)`, never a failure.
  - `bunker.enginelib.gitbundles_module() -> ModuleType`
  - `bunker.gitbundle.UNIT = "git-bundles"`, `ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS = "https"`, `MAX_DEPTH = 4`; `Pin(name: str, repo: str, ref: str, commit: str, submodules: bool, licence: str = "")`; `Built(path: Path, sha256: str, size: int, submodules: tuple[Pin, ...])`; `GitRunner = Callable[[Sequence[str], Path | None, Mapping[str, str], float], subprocess.CompletedProcess[str]]`; `run_git(argv, cwd, env, timeout) -> CompletedProcess[str]`; `build(pin: Pin, workdir: Path, *, top: Pin | None = None, prefix: str = "", run: GitRunner = run_git, allowed: str | None = None) -> Built`; `BundleOutcome(name: str, action: str, reason: str | None = None)`; `hold_bundles(root: Path, idx: Index, pins: Sequence[Pin], *, stamp: str, run: GitRunner | None = None, allowed: str | None = None) -> list[BundleOutcome]`
  - `RunReport.bundles: list[BundleOutcome]`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing kind and routing tests**

In `tests/test_kinds.py` replace `test_the_engine_contract_kinds_are_listed_literally` and `test_the_table_is_complete_and_consistent` (lines 141-174):

```python
ALL_KINDS = {
    "sha256",
    "sha256-publisher",
    "md5-publisher",
    "etag-md5",
    "sha1-publisher",
    "unverified-zip",
    "unverified-fetch",
    "git-commit",
}


def test_the_kinds_are_listed_literally() -> None:
    assert ALL_KINDS == set(KINDS)


def test_the_table_is_complete_and_consistent() -> None:
    assert set(KINDS) == ALL_KINDS
    for name, kind in KINDS.items():
        assert kind.name == name
        assert kind.method in {"fetch", "fetch_md5", "fetch_sha1", "fetch_checked", "git_bundle"}
        assert kind.algorithm in {"sha256", "md5", "sha1"} or kind.unverified or name == "git-commit"
        assert kind.summary
    assert [n for n, k in KINDS.items() if k.unverified] == ["unverified-zip", "unverified-fetch"]
    assert [n for n, k in KINDS.items() if k.zip_structure] == ["unverified-zip"]
    assert checks.is_unverified("unverified-zip") and not checks.is_unverified("sha256")
    assert not checks.is_unverified("git-commit")
    assert not checks.is_unverified("blake3-publisher")
```

and the sheet-routing tests (a fake `Fetcher` method records which one was asked; the digest shapes are Plan A's: a single-part ETag is 32 hex, a multipart one is `<32 hex>-<parts>`):

```python
from types import SimpleNamespace


def routed(bench: Bench, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch, digest: str) -> list[tuple[str, str]]:
    asked: list[tuple[str, str]] = []
    data = b"a us topo sheet " * 500

    def fake(kind: str) -> Any:
        def method(self: Fetcher, url: str, etag: str, *, expected_size: int, mirror: object = None) -> Any:
            asked.append((kind, etag))
            path = self.cache_dir / f"{kind}.part"
            path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
            path.write_bytes(data)
            return SimpleNamespace(path=path, sha256=sha(data), size=len(data))

        return method

    monkeypatch.setattr(Fetcher, "fetch_md5", fake("md5"))
    monkeypatch.setattr(Fetcher, "fetch_etag", fake("etag"), raising=False)
    bench.list([entry("usgs-ustopo", "DE/Test_20260101", "https://p/Test.tif", "etag-md5", digest, size=len(data))])
    assert bench.run().exit_code == 0
    return asked


def test_a_single_part_etag_is_checked_as_an_md5(bench: Bench, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch) -> None:
    assert routed(bench, monkeypatch, "b" * 32) == [("md5", "b" * 32)]


def test_a_multipart_etag_goes_to_fetch_etag_which_can_check_it(bench: Bench, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch) -> None:
    assert routed(bench, monkeypatch, "b" * 32 + "-2") == [("etag", "b" * 32 + "-2")]


def test_a_held_multipart_copy_is_kept_not_refetched_on_the_record(bench: Bench, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch) -> None:
    digest = "b" * 32 + "-2"
    asked = routed(bench, monkeypatch, digest)
    assert len(asked) == 1
    bench.clock.advance(hours=1)
    again = bench.run()
    assert [o.action for o in again.outcomes] == ["verified"], "re-hashed against its sidecar, not fetched"
    assert len(asked) == 1, "an ETag cannot be recomputed; the record is the evidence, so nothing is asked again"
```

(`sha` from `tests.scene`; `Any` is imported by the file. `Bench` and the `bench` fixture are the ones in `tests/test_kinds.py`.)

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_kinds.py -q -x` — Expected: FAIL — `assert {...} == set(KINDS)` (the table lacks `git-commit`).

- [ ] **Step 2: The kind and the download routing**

`src/bunker/checks.py`: append to `KINDS`, after `unverified-fetch`:

```python
        CheckKind(
            "git-commit",
            "git_bundle",
            None,
            False,
            True,
            "the commit id the repository pins; built by the Bunker, never listed by the engine as "
            "an artifact: it clones the repository without checking anything out, confirms the "
            "commit (and the tag, if the pin is one) is in it, and bundles it (bunker.gitbundle); "
            "the engine checks the commit again when it clones the bundle",
        ),
```

`src/bunker/run.py`, `_download`: after the two `needs_digest` / `needs_size` guards and before `fetcher = Fetcher(...)` add

```python
    if kind.method == "git_bundle":
        raise BackendError(
            f"{artifact.unit}/{artifact.name}: a git-commit row is built by bunker.gitbundle, "
            f"never downloaded"
        )
```

and in the chain, before the final `elif digest is not None and artifact.size is not None:` add

```python
    elif (
        artifact.check == "etag-md5"
        and digest is not None
        and artifact.size is not None
        and re.fullmatch(r"[0-9a-f]{32}", digest) is None
    ):
        # A multipart S3 ETag (`<md5>-<parts>`, US Topo and 3DEP sheets): not an MD5 of the
        # bytes, so the engine's s3etag check, which reconstructs it from the part size.
        etag = getattr(fetcher, "fetch_etag", None)
        if etag is None:
            raise BackendError(
                "the installed Hammunition has no Fetcher.fetch_etag, which a multipart ETag needs"
            )
        result = etag(artifact.url, digest, expected_size=artifact.size)
```

(`import re` at the top of `run.py`.) `_matches` needs no change: its record shortcut (the index says this copy was verified against this same digest, and the sidecar matches) answers for a multipart ETag; with no record it hashes the file as an MD5, does not match, and the copy is fetched again, which is safe.

Update `docs`-visible text in the module docstring of `checks.py`: add a sentence that `git-commit` is the Bunker's own.

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_kinds.py -q` — Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 3: The engine's `git_pins` and the import accessor**

`src/bunker/enginelib.py`:

```python
def gitbundles_module() -> ModuleType:
    """``hammunition.gitbundles`` (Plan A Task 15): the engine's bundle naming, which
    the engine's checkout resolves bundles by. Imported when needed, after
    ``hammunition.backends`` (its module notes the same import cycle)."""
    try:
        return importlib.import_module("hammunition.gitbundles")
    except ImportError:
        raise BackendError(
            "the installed Hammunition has no hammunition.gitbundles, whose bundle names the "
            "engine looks up; install the Hammunition release that carries it"
        ) from None
```

`src/bunker/engine.py`: add `"GitPin"` to `__all__`, and

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class GitPin:
    """One repository pin the engine lists (Plan A, ``GitPinEntry``)."""

    name: str
    """``<unit>@<commit>`` (the contract's bundle name)."""
    repo: str
    ref: str
    commit: str
    submodules: bool
```

`Listing` gains `git_pins: tuple[GitPin, ...] = ()`; in `_parse`:

```python
    git_pins: list[GitPin] = []
    for n, raw_pin in enumerate(doc.get("git_pins", [])):
        if not isinstance(raw_pin, dict) or not all(isinstance(raw_pin.get(k), str) for k in ("unit", "name", "repo", "ref")):
            raise EngineError(f"git pin {n} of the engine's document lacks a unit, name, repo or ref")
        commit, reason, flag = raw_pin.get("commit"), raw_pin.get("deferred"), raw_pin.get("submodules")
        if not isinstance(commit, str | None) or not isinstance(reason, str | None) or not isinstance(flag, bool):
            raise EngineError(f"git pin {n} ({raw_pin['name']}) has a malformed commit, deferred or submodules field")
        if raw_pin["unit"] != "git-bundles":
            raise EngineError(f"git pin {n} is in unit {raw_pin['unit']!r}, not git-bundles")
        if reason is not None or commit is None:
            deferred.append(Deferred("git-bundles", raw_pin["name"], reason or "the pin names no commit"))
        else:
            git_pins.append(GitPin(raw_pin["name"], raw_pin["repo"], raw_pin["ref"], commit, flag))
```

(`doc.get("git_pins", [])` must be a list: guard with `if not isinstance(..., list): raise EngineError(...)`), passed to `Listing(git_pins=tuple(git_pins), ...)`. Add to `tests/test_engine.py`:

```python
def test_git_pins_are_read_and_a_deferred_one_is_a_deferral() -> None:
    from tests.helpers import git_pin_item

    commit = "a" * 40
    got = engine._parse(
        _doc_with(
            git_pins=[
                git_pin_item(f"toolx@{commit}", "https://example.invalid/toolx", "v1.0", commit),
                git_pin_item("tooly@v2", "https://example.invalid/tooly", "v2", None, deferred="tag has no recorded commit; offline bundle verification needs a repository pin"),
            ]
        )
    )
    assert [(p.name, p.commit, p.submodules) for p in got.git_pins] == [(f"toolx@{commit}", commit, True)]
    assert [(d.unit, d.name) for d in got.deferred if d.unit == "git-bundles"] == [("git-bundles", "tooly@v2")]


@pytest.mark.parametrize("mutate", [{"name": 3}, {"commit": 5}, {"submodules": "yes"}, {"unit": "other"}])
def test_a_malformed_git_pin_fails_the_listing_by_index(mutate: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    from tests.helpers import git_pin_item

    pin = {**git_pin_item("toolx@" + "a" * 40, "https://x", "v1", "a" * 40), **mutate}
    with pytest.raises(engine.EngineError, match="git pin 0"):
        engine._parse(_doc_with(git_pins=[pin]))
```

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_engine.py -q` — Expected: PASS.

"""Git pins as bundles.

The one place the Bunker runs a program on something it fetched, so it is as
narrow as git allows: ``git clone --no-checkout`` (no working tree, so no
filter, hook or LFS smudge can run), hooks pointed at ``/dev/null``, no global
or system config, no credential prompt, only the transports named in
``GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL`` (``https``), and a URL that is not a transport git would
take as an option. A commit id is the verification: git's object model makes the
bundle hold exactly the pinned commit or the build fails. The engine checks the
commit again when it clones the bundle (it also reads the pinned tag from it, so
tags are kept), and checks each gitlink against the parent's pin.

Names are the engine's (``hammunition.gitbundles.bundle_name``): ``<unit>@<commit>``
and, for each gitlink, ``<unit>@<commit>/<path>@<subcommit>`` where the commit is
the *top* one and the path is the whole path from the top, however deep. The
engine lists the top-level pins (``git_pins``); the gitlinks are read here from
the pinned tree and ``.gitmodules``. A bundle of a pinned commit never changes, so
a held one is rebuilt only if it is missing or ``bunker verify`` marked it corrupted.

def hold_bundles(
    root: Path,
    idx: Index,
    pins: Sequence[Pin],
    *,
    stamp: str,
    run: GitRunner | None = None,
    allowed: str | None = None,

    runner = run if run is not None else run_git

    for pin in pins:
        outcomes += _hold(root, idx, pin, pin, "", stamp, runner, allowed, 0)

```

Details this code relies on: `hold_bundles` reads `run_git` at call time (`run or run_git`), which is what lets the "does not rebuild" test replace `gitbundle.run_git`; `hash_file` returns `(sha256, md5)`; `bundle_name` is Plan A's and raises a `BackendError` (a `ValueError`) on a malformed commit or path, and `_hold` hands the *prefix* of a submodule's own gitlinks as the sub-name's path part (`libs/sub/`), so a grandchild's path is the whole path from the top.

- [ ] **Step 7: Hold bundles in the run**

`src/bunker/run.py`: `from bunker import gitbundle, inputs, publish, signing, statuspage` and `from bunker.gitbundle import BundleOutcome`. `RunReport`: add `bundles: list[BundleOutcome] = field(default_factory=list)`; `exit_code` adds `or any(o.action == "failed" for o in self.bundles)`; `as_dict` adds `"bundles": [asdict(o) for o in self.bundles],`; `summary_lines` adds `for o in self.bundles: if o.action == "failed": lines.append(f"  failed bundle: {o.name}: {o.reason}")`. In `run()`, after the inputs block:

```python
        if not units or gitbundle.UNIT in units:
            licences = got.licences
            pins = [
                gitbundle.Pin(p.name, p.repo, p.ref, p.commit, p.submodules, licences.get(p.name.partition("@")[0], ""))
                for p in got.git_pins
            ]
            report.bundles = gitbundle.hold_bundles(root, idx, pins, stamp=state.stamp)
```

(`got.licences` is the engine's per-unit licence lines; a unit with none falls back to "licence not recorded in this manifest"), and add `known.add(gitbundle.UNIT)` next to the other `known` lines. `_drop` (628-648): before the `kept` list add `bundles = {p.name for p in listing.git_pins}`, and extend the keep condition with `or (e.unit == gitbundle.UNIT and e.name.split("/", 1)[0] in bundles)`, so a listed pin keeps its gitlinks' rows and an unlisted one drops them all. `sweep_incoming` (570-586): before `return removed` add `shutil.rmtree(incoming / gitbundle.UNIT, ignore_errors=True)  # a killed build's scratch clones` (and `import shutil`).

`Dockerfile`: add `git` to the apt list. `tests/test_packaging.py::test_the_image_has_the_signing_tools` gains `"git"` in its tuple (rename it `test_the_image_has_the_tools_it_runs`).

- [ ] **Step 8: Docs and the invariant**

`README.md` table (73-79) and `docs/reference.md` table (102-111): add the row `| \`git-commit\` | the commit id the repository pins; **built by the Bunker with git, never listed by the engine as an artifact**: the engine lists pins in \`git_pins\` | \`bunker.gitbundle\` |` (the docs test requires a row for each kind: ``| `kind` |`` at the start of a line). In `docs/reference.md` add after *Check kinds* a section "Sheets, payloads and git bundles": payloads are `sha256` artifacts with a possibly null size; US Topo and 3DEP sheets are `etag-md5` with the repository-carried ETag, and a multipart ETag (`<md5>-<parts>`) is checked by `Fetcher.fetch_etag`, a single-part one as an MD5; FSTopo is `sha256` or `unverified-fetch`; a git pin becomes `git-bundles/<unit>@<commit>` plus `git-bundles/<unit>@<commit>/<path>@<subcommit>` per gitlink, with the whole path from the top however deep; the Bunker runs `git clone --no-checkout`, `git bundle create --all` and `git bundle verify` with hooks off, no config, no prompt and only `https`; the tag of a tag pin is kept in the bundle and checked to still resolve to the pinned commit; a held bundle is rebuilt only if missing or marked corrupted. `CLAUDE.md` invariant 5 becomes: "**Nothing downloaded is executed, unpacked or parsed** beyond hashing, bar the engine's own structure check of an `unverified-zip` ... and git pins: the Bunker runs `git clone --no-checkout` and `git bundle` on a pinned repository, with hooks off, no config files, no prompt and `https` only, and never checks anything out (`bunker.gitbundle`)." Make the same change to `README.md` lines 124-126 and `docs/guide.md` line 295. `CHANGELOG.md`: "- Payloads, sheets and git bundles: a multipart US Topo or 3DEP ETag is checked with `Fetcher.fetch_etag`; software payloads with no listed size are held (names with `+`, `@` and nested paths tested through the server); the engine's `git_pins` are held as bundles built with `git clone --no-checkout` and `git bundle create --all`, tags and gitlinks included, under the engine's `bundle_name`."

- [ ] **Step 9: Run, falsify, commit**

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -W error::DeprecationWarning; echo "exit=$?"` — Expected: `exit=0` (everything in `test_gitbundle.py` skips where `git` is missing; `test_the_names_are_the_engines_own` skips until the Plan A engine is installed). Regenerate goldens (`run.json` gains `"bundles": []`) with `BUNKER_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py -q` and read the diff.

Falsify: in `build`, delete the `urlsplit(...).scheme not in protocols.split(":") or ...` clause and run `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_gitbundle.py -q -k "option_in_the_place or https_is_the_only"` — Expected: both FAIL (git is handed the text and fails with its own message, not "not allowed"); restore it. Add `--no-tags` to the clone argv and run `-k "tag_pin or clean_environment"` — Expected: both FAIL (the bundle lacks `refs/tags/v1.0`; the argv assertion); restore.

Run: `make check; echo "exit=$?"` — Expected: `exit=0`.

```bash
git add src/bunker/gitbundle.py src/bunker/checks.py src/bunker/engine.py src/bunker/enginelib.py src/bunker/run.py Dockerfile CLAUDE.md README.md docs/reference.md docs/guide.md CHANGELOG.md tests/test_gitbundle.py tests/test_payloads.py tests/test_kinds.py tests/test_engine.py tests/test_packaging.py tests/helpers.py tests/golden
git commit -m "Payloads, multipart sheet ETags and git bundles

A multipart US Topo/3DEP ETag is checked with Fetcher.fetch_etag; payloads with no
listed size are held and their odd names pinned through the server; the engine's
git_pins are built as bundles (clone --no-checkout, tags kept, bundle create --all)
with the engine's names, gitlinks included to any depth, hooks off, https only."
```

### Task 6: Server routes and group mode

The server learns the catalogue's other files: `/catalogue.json` (and `/index.json` as its alias), `/catalogue.sig.d/<n>.sig`, `/inputs/<kind>/<name>`. In `group` mode, `bunker enrol add|list|remove` keeps a list of enrolments on the volume and the server hands the bytes of an `owner:<id>` artifact only to a request whose `X-Hammunition-Enrolment` header is that id and a current enrolment; everyone else gets the same 404 as for a file that does not exist. Bring-your-own kinds (anything under `hold_unverified`) default to `owner:<id>` of the enrolment named by `bunker.byo_owner`, and to an owner nobody can be (`owner:admin`) when none is named. This is a sharing filter, not access control, and the docs say so.

**Files:**
- Create: `src/bunker/enrol.py`, `tests/test_enrol.py`
- Modify: `src/bunker/config.py` (`BunkerConfig`, `_bunker`, `_KNOWN`), `src/bunker/server.py` (`Target` 48-52, `Routes._build` as rewritten in Task 1, `Handler._serve` 165-219), `src/bunker/publish.py`, `src/bunker/cli.py` (`COMMANDS`, `parser`), `docs/reference.md` (Commands, Configuration, HTTP 207-222), `docs/guide.md`, `config.example.toml`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Test: `tests/test_server.py`, `tests/test_enrol.py`, `tests/test_config.py`, `tests/test_publish.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `bunker.checks.is_unverified(check: str) -> bool`, `bunker.index.Index`, `bunker.volume.RunLock`, `bunker.publish.publish`.
- Produces:
  - `bunker.config.BunkerConfig(name: str = "bunker", mode: str = "personal", byo_owner: str | None = None)`
  - `bunker.enrol`: `FILE = ".enrolments.json"`, `ADMIN_OWNER = "owner:admin"`, `class EnrolError(Exception)`, `@dataclass(frozen=True) class Enrolment(id: str, label: str, added: str)`, `load(root: Path) -> list[Enrolment]` (strict), `load_lenient(root: Path) -> list[Enrolment]` (empty on any error: fail closed), `add(root: Path, label: str, now: str) -> Enrolment`, `remove(root: Path, ref: str) -> Enrolment`, `default_share(mode: str, check: str, owner_label: str | None, enrolments: Sequence[Enrolment]) -> str`
  - `bunker.server.ENROLMENT_HEADER = "X-Hammunition-Enrolment"`; `Target(path: str, content_type: str, owner: str | None = None)`; `Routes.may_read(owner: str, header: str | None) -> bool`
  - CLI: `bunker enrol add LABEL`, `bunker enrol list`, `bunker enrol remove REF`; the `enrol` document (`action`, `enrolment`, `enrolments`)

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Create `tests/test_enrol.py`:

- [ ] **Step 4: Apply the shares when publishing**

`src/bunker/publish.py`: `from bunker import enginelib, enrol, index, signing`, and in `publish` after `idx.name, idx.mode = ...`:

```python
    enrolments = enrol.load_lenient(root)
    for entry in idx.artifacts:
        entry.share = enrol.default_share(
            cfg.bunker.mode, entry.publisher_check, cfg.bunker.byo_owner, enrolments
        )
```

- [ ] **Step 5: The server**

`src/bunker/server.py`: `import hmac`, `import re`, `from bunker import enrol`, then

```python
ENROLMENT_HEADER = "X-Hammunition-Enrolment"
_SIGNATURE = re.compile(r"catalogue\.sig\.d/[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}\.sig")


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Target:
    path: str
    """Relative to the volume root."""
    content_type: str
    owner: str | None = None
    """An enrolment id: only a request that sends it is answered."""
```

In `Routes.__init__` add `self._enrol_stamp: tuple[int, int, int] | None = None` and `self._enrolled: frozenset[str] = frozenset()`. In `_build`, after the artifacts loop (inside, replace the three `Target` constructions) use:

```python
        group = isinstance(raw, dict) and isinstance(raw.get("bunker"), dict) and raw["bunker"].get("mode") == "group"
        ...
            share = item.get("share")
            owner = share[len("owner:") :] if group and isinstance(share, str) and share.startswith("owner:") else None
            data = Target(path, "application/octet-stream", owner)
            routes.setdefault(f"{unit}/{name}", data)
            routes.setdefault(path, data)
            routes.setdefault(path + SIDECAR, Target(path + SIDECAR, "text/plain; charset=utf-8", owner))
```

and after the loop:

```python
        signers = raw.get("signers") if isinstance(raw, dict) else None
        for signer in signers if isinstance(signers, list) else []:
            signature = signer.get("signature") if isinstance(signer, dict) else None
            if isinstance(signature, str) and _SIGNATURE.fullmatch(signature):
                routes.setdefault(signature, Target(signature, "application/octet-stream"))
        held = raw.get("inputs") if isinstance(raw, dict) else None
        for item in held if isinstance(held, list) else []:
            if not isinstance(item, dict):
                continue
            kind, name, path = item.get("kind"), item.get("name"), item.get("path")
            if isinstance(kind, str) and isinstance(name, str) and isinstance(path, str) and kind and name and path:
                routes.setdefault(f"inputs/{kind}/{name}", Target(path, "application/octet-stream"))
                routes.setdefault(path, Target(path, "application/octet-stream"))
                routes.setdefault(path + SIDECAR, Target(path + SIDECAR, "text/plain; charset=utf-8"))
```

Add to `Routes`:

```python
    def may_read(self, owner: str, header: str | None) -> bool:
        """Whether a request carrying *header* may have bytes owned by *owner*:
        the header is exactly that id, and that id is a current enrolment."""
        if not header or not header.isascii() or not owner.isascii():
            return False
        if not hmac.compare_digest(header.encode(), owner.encode()):
            return False
        try:
            info = os.stat(self.root / enrol.FILE)
            stamp: tuple[int, int, int] | None = (info.st_mtime_ns, info.st_size, info.st_ino)
        except OSError:
            stamp = None
        with self._lock:
            if stamp != self._enrol_stamp:
                self._enrolled = frozenset(e.id for e in enrol.load_lenient(self.root))
                self._enrol_stamp = stamp
            return header in self._enrolled
```

In `Handler._serve`, after `if target is None or path is None:` block:

```python
        if target.owner is not None and not self.routes.may_read(
            target.owner, self.headers.get(ENROLMENT_HEADER)
        ):
            self._plain(404, "not found")  # the same answer as a file that is not there
            return
```

and change the no-cache condition to `if target.path in ("catalogue.json", "index.json", "status.html") or target.path.startswith("catalogue.sig.d/"):`. Update the module docstring: the allow-list now also names the signatures and inputs the catalogue lists, and gates `owner:` bytes in group mode.

- [ ] **Step 6: The `enrol` command**

`src/bunker/cli.py`: `from bunker import ... enrol ...`, and

```python
def _enrol_body(root: Path, *, enrolment: enrol.Enrolment | None = None) -> dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        "enrolment": asdict(enrolment) if enrolment else None,
        "enrolments": [asdict(e) for e in enrol.load_lenient(root)],
    }


def cmd_enrol(args: argparse.Namespace, emit: Emit | None) -> int:
    cfg = _config(args)
    root = cfg.storage.root
    code, changed = EXIT_OK, None
    if args.enrol_command != "list":
        if cfg.bunker.mode != "group":
            _err("this Bunker is in personal mode: enrolments filter what a group Bunker shares "
                 "([bunker] mode = \"group\"); in personal mode every artifact is shared")
            return EXIT_REFUSED
        now = _now_iso()
        root.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        with RunLock(root):
            try:
                changed = (
                    enrol.add(root, args.label, now)
                    if args.enrol_command == "add"
                    else enrol.remove(root, args.ref)
                )
            except enrol.EnrolError as exc:
                _err(str(exc))
                return EXIT_REFUSED
            try:
                publish.publish(cfg, index.load(root), generated=now)
            except signing.PublishFailed as exc:
                _err(f"the enrolments changed but the catalogue was not republished: {exc}")
                code = EXIT_FAILED
    body = _enrol_body(root, enrolment=changed)
    if emit is not None:
        emit("enrol", body)
        return code
    if args.enrol_command == "add" and changed is not None:
        print(
            f"Enrolled {changed.label!r} as {changed.id}. Give that id to the laptop's operator "
            f"(`hammunition mirror enrol`); it is sent as {server.ENROLMENT_HEADER}. It filters "
            f"what is shared; it is not access control."
        )
    elif args.enrol_command == "remove" and changed is not None:
        print(f"Removed {changed.label!r} ({changed.id}); its owned artifacts are no longer served to it.")
    else:
        for e in body["enrolments"]:
            print(f"  {e['id']}  {e['label']}  (added {e['added']})")
        if not body["enrolments"]:
            print("No enrolments.")
    return code
```

Add `"enrol": cmd_enrol,` to `COMMANDS` and to `parser()`:

```python
    p_enrol = sub.add_parser("enrol", help="who a group Bunker shares owned artifacts with")
    enrol_sub = p_enrol.add_subparsers(dest="enrol_command", required=True, metavar="ACTION")
    p_e_add = enrol_sub.add_parser("add", parents=[common], help="enrol a laptop; prints its id")
    p_e_add.add_argument("label", help="a name for you to recognise it by")
    enrol_sub.add_parser("list", parents=[common], help="the enrolments")
    p_e_remove = enrol_sub.add_parser("remove", parents=[common], help="remove an enrolment")
    p_e_remove.add_argument("ref", metavar="ID_OR_LABEL")
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run, docs, falsify, commit**

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -W error::DeprecationWarning; echo "exit=$?"` — Expected: `exit=0`.

`docs/reference.md`: Commands rows `bunker enrol add LABEL`, `bunker enrol list`, `bunker enrol remove ID_OR_LABEL` (JSON kind `enrol`); config row `bunker.byo_owner`; HTTP table rows for `/catalogue.json`, `/index.json` (alias), `/catalogue.sig.d/<n>.sig`, `/inputs/<kind>/<name>` (+ `.sha256`); a `## Group mode` section: how `share` is set (public data `all`; anything under `hold_unverified` goes to the `byo_owner` enrolment, or `owner:admin`, which nobody can read, when none is set); that the server answers an `owner:<id>` artifact (its `<unit>/<name>`, its volume path and its sidecar) only to a request whose `X-Hammunition-Enrolment` is that id and a current enrolment, with the same 404 as a missing file; that a removed enrolment loses access at once but the catalogue lists the artifact regardless (the engine skips what is not shared with it); and, in bold, **this is a sharing filter, not access control: the id is sent in clear over plain HTTP, any host on the LAN that learns it can send it, and nothing secret belongs on a Bunker**. `docs/guide.md`: a short "Group mode" section with the same warning and the enrol-then-`hammunition mirror enrol` flow. `config.example.toml` `[bunker]`: add `# byo_owner = "alice-laptop"   # group mode: who owns what is held under hold_unverified`. `CHANGELOG.md`: "- Group mode: `bunker enrol add|list|remove`, enrolments in `.enrolments.json`, `X-Hammunition-Enrolment` gating of `owner:<id>` artifacts (404 otherwise), `bunker.byo_owner` for what is held under `hold_unverified`; the server also serves `/catalogue.sig.d/<n>.sig` and `/inputs/<kind>/<name>`."

Falsify: in `Routes._build` give the sidecar `Target` no owner (revert to `Target(path + SIDECAR, "text/plain; charset=utf-8")`); `test_the_volume_path_and_the_sidecar_of_owned_bytes_are_gated_too` FAILS (200 without the header); restore. Delete the `enrol.load_lenient` re-read (cache forever) and `test_a_removed_enrolment_loses_the_bytes_at_once` FAILS; restore.

Run: `make check; echo "exit=$?"` — Expected: `exit=0`.

```bash
git add src/bunker/enrol.py src/bunker/config.py src/bunker/server.py src/bunker/publish.py src/bunker/cli.py config.example.toml docs/reference.md docs/guide.md CHANGELOG.md tests/test_enrol.py tests/test_server.py tests/test_config.py
git commit -m "Server routes for the catalogue files; group-mode enrolments

/catalogue.json, /index.json alias, /catalogue.sig.d/<n>.sig, /inputs/<kind>/<name>;

matching X-Hammunition-Enrolment (404 otherwise); BYO kinds default to the
byo_owner enrolment. A sharing filter, not access control, and the docs say so."
```

### Task 7: The status page and `bunker status` show the keys

A new *Signing* section lists every key with its algorithm, size and whether it is hardware, when it last signed and whether it is in the published catalogue, repeats the engine's weak-key warning for any key it applies to, and says plainly when no hardware key is configured. `bunker status` and its `--json` document carry the same facts (without the warning text, which depends on the installed engine; `bunker keys list` has it).

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/bunker/statuspage.py` (imports 15-22, `render` 79-214, `write` 217-220), `src/bunker/cli.py` (`_status_body` 306-333, `cmd_status` 336-373), `tests/test_statuspage.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`, `tests/golden/status.json`, `docs/reference.md` (`--json` documents table, status row), `docs/guide.md` (section 5, 189-215), `CHANGELOG.md`
- Test: `tests/test_statuspage.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `bunker.keys.KeyView`, `bunker.keys.views`, `bunker.keys.describe`, `bunker.signing.load_registry`, `bunker.signing.load_signed`, `Index.signers`, `Index.serial`.
- Produces: `statuspage.render(index: Index, *, disk_used: int, keys: Sequence[KeyView] = ()) -> str`; `statuspage.key_views(root: Path, index: Index) -> list[KeyView]`; `cli._status_body(root: Path, idx: Index) -> dict[str, Any]` gains `serial`, `hardware_key`, `keys`, `weak_keys`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing page tests**

Append to `tests/test_statuspage.py`:

`src/bunker/statuspage.py`: add `from collections.abc import Sequence`, `from bunker import __version__, keys, signing`, `from bunker.keys import KeyView`; change `render`'s signature to `def render(index: Index, *, disk_used: int, keys: Sequence[KeyView] = ()) -> str:` (rename the module import to `from bunker import keys as keymod` so the parameter does not shadow it), and insert after the *Last run* block (before `per_unit`):

        )

```

Add:

```python
def key_views(root: Path, index: Index) -> list[KeyView]:
    """The registry's keys as the page and ``bunker status`` show them."""
    try:
        registry = signing.load_registry(root)
    except signing.SigningError:
        return []
    return keymod.views(registry, signing.load_signed(root), {str(s.get("id")) for s in index.signers})
```

and change `write` to `write_atomic(root / "status.html", render(index, disk_used=disk_used(root), keys=key_views(root, index)).encode("utf-8"))`. Update the closing paragraph's link text to `catalogue.json` if Task 1 did not.

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_statuspage.py -q` — Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 3: `bunker status`**

Write the failing test in `tests/test_cli.py`:

```python
def test_status_says_when_no_hardware_key_is_configured_and_lists_the_keys(invoke: Any, scene: Scene) -> None:
    invoke("run")
    code, out, _ = invoke("status")
    assert code == 0
    assert "Signing: catalogue serial 1, 1 active key(s)" in out
    assert "No hardware key configured" in out
    code, out, _ = invoke("status", "--json")
    document = json.loads(out)
    assert document["serial"] == 1 and document["hardware_key"] is False
    assert [k["backend"] for k in document["keys"]] == ["file"] and "warning" not in document["keys"][0]
    assert document["weak_keys"] == []
```

Run it — Expected: FAIL (`Signing:` not in the output).

In `src/bunker/cli.py` change `_status_body` to `def _status_body(root: Path, idx: index.Index) -> dict[str, Any]:` and import `statuspage` into `cli`. Before its `return`, add

```python
    shown = statuspage.key_views(root, idx)
    weak = [
        k.id
        for k in shown
        if k.retired is None and k.warning and not k.warning.startswith("strength not checked")
    ]
```

and add these entries to the returned dict:

```python
        "serial": idx.serial or None,
        "hardware_key": any(k.hardware and k.retired is None for k in shown),
        "keys": [
            {key: value for key, value in asdict(k).items() if key != "warning"} for k in shown
        ],
        "weak_keys": weak,
```

`cmd_status` calls `_status_body(cfg.storage.root, index.load(cfg.storage.root))`; in the text branch, after the `Held:` line, print

```python
    active = [k for k in body["keys"] if not k["retired"]]
    print(f"Signing: catalogue serial {body['serial'] or 'none yet'}, {len(active)} active key(s)")
    for k in body["keys"]:
        if k["id"] in body["weak_keys"]:
            print(f"  weak key: {k['id']} ({k['algorithm']} {k['bits']}-bit): replace it (`bunker keys list`)")
    if not body["hardware_key"]:
        print("  No hardware key configured (recommended: `bunker keys add --backend security-key`).")
```

Regenerate: `BUNKER_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py -q`; read the diff of `tests/golden/status.json`: it gains `serial`, `hardware_key`, `keys` (the one fake key, `in_catalogue` true, `last_signed` the scene clock) and `weak_keys: []`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Docs, falsification, commit**

`docs/reference.md`: the `status` row of the documents table gains `serial`, `hardware_key`, `keys` (`id`, `backend`, `algorithm`, `bits`, `hardware`, `retired`, `added`, `last_signed`, `in_catalogue`), `weak_keys`. `docs/guide.md` section 5: add "- **Signing**: each key with its algorithm, size and kind, when it last signed, and whether it is in the published catalogue; a weak key (RSA of 2048 bits or fewer) with the suite's warning; and a plain line when no hardware key is configured." `CHANGELOG.md`: "- The status page and `bunker status` show the signing keys: algorithm, size, hardware or file, last signature, weak-key warnings and a line when no hardware key is configured."

Falsify: change `warn if k.warning.startswith(...)` to always `"warn"`; `test_a_weak_key_carries_the_engines_warning_and_is_marked` FAILS (`class="bad"` missing); restore.

Run: `make check; echo "exit=$?"` — Expected: `exit=0`.

```bash
git add src/bunker/statuspage.py src/bunker/cli.py tests/test_statuspage.py tests/test_cli.py tests/golden/status.json docs/reference.md docs/guide.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Status page and bunker status show the signing keys

Algorithm, size, hardware or file, last signature, whether each is in the
published catalogue, the engine's weak-key warning, and a plain line when no
hardware key is configured."
```

### Task 8: `bunker export --to DIR`

`bunker export --to DIR` writes the published catalogue, its signatures, the inputs and every file in the layout the server answers (`<dir>/<unit>/<name>` is the file itself, `<dir>/inputs/<kind>/<name>`, `<dir>/catalogue.json`, `<dir>/catalogue.sig.d/<n>.sig`), so a drive plugged into a laptop reads the same paths a LAN mirror serves (Plan A Task 4 already gives the engine a `file://` reader for exactly these paths, so this task produces the drive it reads). Every byte is re-hashed against the catalogue while it is copied. The old catalogue on the drive is removed first and the new one written last, so a copy that stops halfway leaves a drive no laptop will believe.

**Files:**
- Create: `src/bunker/export.py`, `tests/test_export.py`
- Modify: `src/bunker/cli.py` (`COMMANDS`, `parser`), `docs/reference.md`, `docs/guide.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Test: `tests/test_export.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `bunker.index.FILE`, `bunker.volume.RunLock`, `artifact_dir`, `input_path`, `UnsafeName`; the published `catalogue.json` and `catalogue.sig.d/`.
- Produces: `bunker.export.ExportError(Exception)`, `ExportRefused(ExportError)`, `ExportFailed(ExportError)`; `ExportReport(to: str, serial: int, files: int = 0, bytes: int = 0, skipped_owned: list[str], failed: list[dict[str, str]])` with `exit_code` and `as_dict()`; `export(cfg: Config, to: Path) -> ExportReport`; CLI `bunker export --to DIR [--json]`, document kind `export`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

"""``bunker export --to DIR``: the published catalogue, its signatures, the
inputs and every file, in the layout the server answers.

``<dir>/<unit>/<name>`` is the file itself (on the volume it is a directory
holding the dated file), so a reader of a directory asks the paths a reader of
a LAN mirror asks. Order is what makes a drive safe to unplug at any moment:
the previous catalogue and signatures are removed first, files and inputs are
copied (each re-hashed against the catalogue while it is read), the signatures
follow, and the catalogue is written last. A copy that stops halfway has no
catalogue, and a laptop does not believe a drive without one.

A group Bunker's ``owner:`` artifacts are not written: a drive has no
enrolment header, so copying them would hand them to whoever holds it. The
catalogue still lists them (it is signed as it is); the engine skips what is
not shared with it.

The lock message is "a run is in progress (…/.lock is held)", which the test matches.

- [ ] **Step 3: The command**

`src/bunker/cli.py`: `from bunker import ... export ...`, and

```python
def cmd_export(args: argparse.Namespace, emit: Emit | None) -> int:
    cfg = _config(args)
    try:
        report = export.export(cfg, args.to)
    except export.ExportRefused as exc:
        _err(str(exc))
        return EXIT_REFUSED
    except export.ExportFailed as exc:
        _err(str(exc))
        return EXIT_FAILED
    if emit is not None:
        emit("export", report.as_dict())
        return report.exit_code
    print(
        f"bunker export: catalogue serial {report.serial} and {report.files} files "
        f"({report.bytes} bytes) written to {report.to}"
    )
    for label in report.skipped_owned:
        print(f"  not written (owned by an enrolment, not shared with a drive): {label}")
    for failure in report.failed:
        print(f"  not exported: {failure['name']}: {failure['reason']}")
    return report.exit_code
```

`"export": cmd_export,` in `COMMANDS`; in `parser()`:

```python
    p_export = sub.add_parser("export", parents=[common], help="write the catalogue and files to a directory or drive")
    p_export.add_argument("--to", type=Path, required=True, metavar="DIR", help="an empty or previous-export directory outside the volume")
```

(`ExportRefused` is caught inside `cmd_export`; a `Locked` never escapes `export`.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, docs, falsify, commit**

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -W error::DeprecationWarning; echo "exit=$?"` — Expected: `exit=0`.

`docs/reference.md`: Commands row `bunker export --to DIR` (JSON `export`: `to`, `serial`, `files`, `bytes`, `skipped_owned`, `failed`, `exit_code`); exit codes (2 when the target overlaps the volume or there is no catalogue yet, 1 when a file failed or the target filled up, 125 while a run holds the volume). `docs/guide.md`: a section "Taking the catalogue to a drive": what is written and in what layout, that the previous catalogue on the drive is removed first and the new one written last so unplugging early leaves a drive nobody believes, that a group Bunker's `owner:` files are not written, that the drive can be any filesystem the laptop reads, that the engine already reads a `file://` catalogue from such a drive (Plan A Task 4), and how to check a drive by hand with `ssh-keygen -Y verify` as in the signing section. `CHANGELOG.md`: "- `bunker export --to DIR`: the catalogue, its signatures, the inputs and every file in the served layout, each re-hashed against the catalogue as it is copied; the catalogue is removed first and written last."

Falsify: in `_export` move the catalogue write above the artifact loop; `test_a_full_drive_leaves_no_catalogue_behind` FAILS (a catalogue is left behind); restore. In `_copy` skip the `expected` comparison; `test_a_source_file_that_no_longer_matches...` FAILS; restore.

Run: `make check; echo "exit=$?"` — Expected: `exit=0`.

```bash
git add src/bunker/export.py src/bunker/cli.py tests/test_export.py docs/reference.md docs/guide.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "bunker export --to DIR: the catalogue and files in the served layout

Each file re-hashed against the catalogue as it is copied; the old catalogue is
removed first and the new one written last, so a drive that stops halfway has
none; a group Bunker's owner: files are not written."
```

### Task 9: Hardware keys in the container — commented examples and a guide section

The Bunker runs in a container, so a token has to be handed to it on purpose: a FIDO2 key as its `/dev/hidraw*` node, a PIV card by mounting the host's `pcscd` socket (or a host `ssh-agent` socket). `compose.yaml` and the Podman quadlet get **commented** examples and never a default device mapping; `docs/guide.md` gets the section that explains when and how, with every step nobody has run on the NAS marked as a bench item.

**Files:**
- Modify: `compose.yaml` (after `security_opt` 33-34, in `volumes` 24-28), `packaging/bunker.container` (after `NoNewPrivileges` 31), `docs/guide.md` (new section before "Security posture" 276), `README.md` (feature list), `tests/test_packaging.py`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Test: `tests/test_packaging.py`, `tests/test_docs.py` (unchanged: holds links and cited paths)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `[signing] agent_socket` (Task 3), `bunker keys add --backend security-key|agent` (Task 3).
- Produces: nothing importable; two tests that fail if a device or socket mapping is ever uncommented.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append to `tests/test_packaging.py` (the file already has `ROOT`, `yaml`, `re` and `Any`):

```python
def _compose_text() -> str:
    return (ROOT / "compose.yaml").read_text()


def _quadlet_text() -> str:
    return (ROOT / "packaging" / "bunker.container").read_text()


def test_no_token_is_mapped_by_default() -> None:
    """A token passthrough widens what the container can reach: it is the
    operator's decision for their own hardware, never a default."""
    service = yaml.safe_load(_compose_text())["services"]["bunker"]
    assert "devices" not in service and "privileged" not in service
    assert not [v for v in service["volumes"] if "pcscd" in v or "hidraw" in v or "agent" in v]
    assert "device_cgroup_rules" not in service
    quadlet = _quadlet_text()
    assert not re.search(r"^(AddDevice|Volume|PodmanArgs)=.*(hidraw|pcscd|agent|--device)", quadlet, re.M)


def test_the_hardware_examples_are_there_and_every_one_is_a_comment() -> None:
    compose, quadlet = _compose_text(), _quadlet_text()
    assert "#   - /dev/hidraw" in compose and "#   - /run/pcscd/pcscd.comm" in compose
    assert "# AddDevice=/dev/hidraw" in quadlet and "# Volume=/run/pcscd/pcscd.comm" in quadlet
    for text in (compose, quadlet):
        for line in text.splitlines():
            if "hidraw" in line or "pcscd" in line:
                assert line.lstrip().startswith("#"), f"a hardware mapping is not a comment: {line!r}"
    assert "docs/guide.md" in compose, "the example points at the section that explains it"
```

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_packaging.py -q -k "token or hardware"` — Expected: `test_no_token_is_mapped_by_default` PASSES (nothing is mapped yet); `test_the_hardware_examples_are_there...` FAILS on `assert "#   - /dev/hidraw" in compose`.

- [ ] **Step 2: `compose.yaml`**

Insert after the `security_opt:` block (after line 34):

```yaml
    # --- Hardware signing keys: examples, all commented out ----------------------
    # docs/guide.md, "Hardware signing keys", says when this is worth doing and
    # what has and has not been run on a NAS. Nothing here is on by default: handing
    # a token to the container is a decision about your own hardware.
    #
    # A FIDO2 security key (any: YubiKey, Immurok, SoloKey, Nitrokey, Token2, Feitian)
    # is passed in as its hidraw node. `fido2-token -L` on the host names it. The
    # container's user (uid 10001) must be allowed to open that node.
    # devices:
    #   - /dev/hidraw3:/dev/hidraw3
    #
    # A PIV smart card is reached through the host's pcscd: add this line to `volumes`
    # above (the host runs pcscd; the image carries opensc and the pcsc client library).
    #   - /run/pcscd/pcscd.comm:/run/pcscd/pcscd.comm
    # Or hand over a host ssh-agent that already holds the key, and set
    # [signing] agent_socket = "/run/agent.sock" in bunker.toml:
    #   - /run/user/1026/agent.sock:/run/agent.sock
```

The `volumes:` list keeps its two real entries; the two commented list items sit below the `devices:` comment so the mapping stays one block of comments.

- [ ] **Step 3: The quadlet**

Insert after `NoNewPrivileges=true` in `packaging/bunker.container`:

```ini
# Hardware signing keys: examples, commented out (docs/guide.md, "Hardware signing keys").
# Rootless Podman can only pass a device your own user may open; the usual route is a
# udev rule that gives the logged-in user the token (uaccess), checked with
# `ls -l /dev/hidraw*` before and after. Nothing here is on by default.
# A FIDO2 security key, as its hidraw node (`fido2-token -L` names it):
# AddDevice=/dev/hidraw3
# A PIV smart card, through the host's pcscd:
# Volume=/run/pcscd/pcscd.comm:/run/pcscd/pcscd.comm
```

- [ ] **Step 4: The guide section**

Insert before `## Security posture` in `docs/guide.md`:

````markdown
## Hardware signing keys

A laptop that enrols your Bunker accepts a catalogue only if a key it was shown signed it. By default the
Bunker signs with a **file key** in `<volume>/.keys`, which is enough to make the catalogue tamper-evident
but means a copy of the volume (a backup, a stolen disk) is a copy of the key. A hardware key keeps the
private half on a token: it is **recommended, never required**, and the Bunker works without one (the status
page keeps a line saying none is configured).

**Which token.** Any FIDO2 authenticator: a YubiKey, an Immurok, a SoloKey, a Nitrokey, a Token2, a Feitian.
The Bunker asks for an `ed25519-sk` key and falls back to `ecdsa-sk` (P-256) if the token cannot do Ed25519;
FIDO2 has no RSA. A PIV smart card signs through `ssh-agent` and PKCS#11: RSA 3072 or 4096 and P-384 on a
YubiKey with firmware 5.7 or newer, ECDSA and RSA on older PIV tokens. Keys are classified by the same rule
the laptops use; RSA of 2048 bits or fewer is accepted and warned, wherever it is shown.

**Touch or no touch.** A key made with touch needs someone to tap the token whenever the catalogue changes
(`bunker run`, a key or enrolment change): a scheduled refresh at 03:00 with nobody there waits
`signing.sign_timeout` seconds (60) and then publishes with the keys that could sign. A key made
`--no-touch` signs unattended. The usual arrangement is both: a file key that signs every scheduled refresh
and a touch-required token that adds its signature when you are there. Losing one token never locks the
fleet out, because a laptop accepts a catalogue when any key it enrolled signed it. (A laptop can be set to
require a hardware signature.)

**Passing a token to the container.** `compose.yaml` and `packaging/bunker.container` carry commented
examples and map nothing by default.

1. With the token plugged into the NAS, find its node: `fido2-token -L` (the image has it too).
2. Uncomment the `devices:` example with that node, and make sure uid 10001 (or your user, under rootless
   Podman) may open it. On a Debian host a udev rule that grants the logged-in user the token does it;
   on a Synology it is a bench item (below).
3. Redeploy, then make the key at a terminal, because the token asks for its PIN and a touch:

   ```
   podman exec -it hammunition-bunker bunker keys add --backend security-key
   podman exec -it hammunition-bunker bunker keys add --backend security-key --no-touch
   ```

   (Docker Compose: `docker exec -it ...`.) `bunker keys list` shows it, with `hardware` and when it last
   signed.
4. For a **PIV** card, either mount the host's `pcscd` socket and load the card into an agent inside the
   container, or run `ssh-agent` on the host, `ssh-add -s <the opensc PKCS#11 module>` there, mount the agent
   socket and set `[signing] agent_socket = "/run/agent.sock"`. Then register its public key (`ssh-add -L`
   prints it): `bunker keys add --backend agent --public-key key.pub --hardware`. The Bunker stores only the
   public half, in a file with no private key beside it, so signing must go through the agent.
5. Retire a lost token with `bunker keys retire FINGERPRINT`; the catalogue is signed again at once without it.

**What has been run and what has not.** Signing and verifying with file keys (Ed25519, ECDSA, RSA) and with a
real `ssh-agent` is covered by the test suite and was measured with OpenSSH 10.3. Not run, and to be run on
the NAS before you rely on it: signing with a FIDO2 token from inside the container (touch and no-touch);
the Immurok's algorithms; a PIV RSA key through the agent; the hidraw permissions on a Synology; how long a
touch-required signature takes on a scheduled refresh; and whether `ykman` in Ubuntu's archive can generate
RSA 3072 or 4096 in PIV on firmware 5.7.
````

`README.md`: add one bullet to the feature list near the top (read the file for the list it already has): "- **Signed.** The Bunker publishes a signed catalogue of everything it holds; file keys by default, FIDO2 and PIV hardware keys when you want them (`docs/guide.md`, *Hardware signing keys*)."

- [ ] **Step 5: Run, falsify, commit**

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_packaging.py tests/test_docs.py -q; echo "exit=$?"` — Expected: `exit=0`.

Falsify: uncomment `#   - /dev/hidraw3:/dev/hidraw3` into a real `devices:` entry in `compose.yaml` and run `-k token` — Expected: `test_no_token_is_mapped_by_default` FAILS on `"devices" not in service`; restore.

`CHANGELOG.md`: "- Hardware keys in the container: commented examples for a FIDO2 `/dev/hidraw*` passthrough and the host `pcscd` or `ssh-agent` socket in `compose.yaml` and the quadlet (never a default mapping, tested), and a guide section on tokens, touch and no-touch, PIV, and what has not been run on a NAS."

Run: `make check; echo "exit=$?"` — Expected: `exit=0`.

```bash
git add compose.yaml packaging/bunker.container docs/guide.md README.md CHANGELOG.md tests/test_packaging.py
git commit -m "Hardware keys: commented device and socket examples, never a default

```

### Task 10: The network-isolated integration test

One test proves the whole chain with the internet gone: a real Bunker volume, signed with a real key, served by the real server, and the **pinned engine** in a network namespace where nothing but the Bunker answers. An offline data-unit install succeeds, and a missing catalogue, a bad signature and an older serial each refuse.

**How the namespace is made, and why not a veth pair or Podman.** The spec allows `unshare -n` plus a veth pair, or Podman's internal network. This test uses the simpler thing that gives the same guarantee: `unshare -r -n` (a fresh user and network namespace; measured on the maintainer's laptop to work unprivileged, with `lo` as its only interface and `ENETUNREACH` for any address outside it), with **both** the Bunker's server and the engine run inside it. "Only the Bunker is reachable" then holds by construction rather than by a firewall rule: there is no other interface to reach anything on, and the test probes it (the internet, the loopback publisher of the first phase, an unused loopback port) before it believes the rest. Where unprivileged user namespaces are refused (GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-24.04` restricts them with AppArmor), the harness falls back to `sudo -n unshare -n`, which hosted runners allow; where neither works (the distro-matrix containers, an unprivileged laptop) the tests skip with the reason. The repository's CI is GYST's `python-ci`, which runs `test-command` on the hosted runners and in the distro containers and has no container-run job of its own, so this is the one mechanism that needs no new job and no new GYST pin. *Not measured:* that `sudo -n unshare -n` works on a hosted runner (it is documented to; the first CI run decides).

**The test runs the engine, which writes state.** It only runs when `BUNKER_NETNS_TEST=1` **and** (`CI=true` or `BUNKER_NETNS_THROWAWAY=1`): never on a machine whose Hammunition station matters (an earlier fixture capture overwrote a real station file through a `HOME` override). Every engine step gets a `HOME` and `XDG_*` inside `tmp_path`, and under `unshare -r` the engine's user is uid 0 in a namespace that owns nothing outside it.

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/netns.py`, `tests/netns_scenario.py`, `tests/test_offline_integration.py`
- Modify: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (the `install-command` and `test-command` values of the `ci` job only; the `uses:` pin line is not touched), `CONTRIBUTING.md` (the checks table, a section), `CHANGELOG.md`
- Test: `tests/test_offline_integration.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `bunker.server.make_server`, `bunker.run.run`, `bunker.publish.publish`, `bunker.signing.SshKeygenBackend`, `tests.realkeys.make_file_key`, `tests.conftest.Publisher`; Plan A: `hammunition.signers`, the engine's `mirror enrol` and `install --offline`.
- Produces: `tests.netns.allowed() -> bool`; `isolation_prefix() -> list[str] | None`; `run_scenario(spec: dict[str, Any], prefix: Sequence[str], *, timeout: float = 600.0) -> Outcome`; `Outcome(probes: dict[str, bool], steps: list[StepResult], bunker_log: str)` with `step(name)` and `isolated()`; `StepResult(name, returncode, stdout, stderr)`; `EngineDriver(command: str, catalog: Path)` with `enrol(url, fingerprint)` and `install(unit)`; `make_engine_catalog(source: Path, dest: Path, *, url: str, data: bytes) -> None`.

> **Which parts need the Plan A engine release.** Needs nothing: `tests/netns.py`, `tests/netns_scenario.py` and `test_the_namespace_reaches_only_the_bunker` (it fetches the catalogue and fails to fetch the internet from inside the namespace, with the Python standard library). Needs Plan A: the other four tests (`hammunition.signers` is imported first, so they skip on v0.21.0) and, inside them, the engine command lines, all read in Plan A (Task 3, Task 5, Task 4, Task 2): `hammunition --catalog DIR mirror enrol URL` takes no `--yes` and asks only at a terminal ("Type one or more fingerprints, comma-separated: "), so the test answers it on a pseudo-terminal; `hammunition --catalog DIR install UNIT --offline --yes` (`install` takes `NAME...`, `--dry-run`, `--yes`) plans from the enrolled Bunker's catalogue. The refusals are Plan A's own words: a lower serial, "serial N is older than accepted serial M; restore confirmed? hammunition mirror accept-older"; a signature that does not verify, "no enrolled signature verified"; a catalogue the transport cannot read, an error naming `catalogue.json` (Plan A does not fix this wording, so the test asserts only the word "catalogue"; see "Needs from Plan A"). Still unread: whether a `data` unit installs without a saved station or a root-owned prefix (`unshare -r` makes the engine uid 0 in the namespace, which may be enough for a user data prefix and not for a system one); the first run on the Plan A engine settles it.

Run: `BUNKER_NETNS_TEST=1 BUNKER_NETNS_THROWAWAY=1 HAMMUNITION_CATALOG=/path/to/Hammunition/catalog .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_offline_integration.py -q` against the Plan A checkout in a throwaway VM — Expected: all five PASS. On the pinned v0.21.0: the four engine tests SKIP (`hammunition.signers` comes with the Plan A engine release) and the harness test passes.

- [ ] **Step 4: CI, CONTRIBUTING, the GYST issue**

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` — change only these two values inside the `ci` job's `with:` (leave the `uses:` line, `runners`, `distros`, `python-versions` and everything else byte-identical):

```yaml
      install-command: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade "pip>=25.3"
        pip install -e ".[dev]"
        if command -v git >/dev/null 2>&1; then
          git clone --depth 1 --branch v0.21.0 https://github.com/Renegade-Penguin/Hammunition "$RUNNER_TEMP/hammunition" \
            && echo "HAMMUNITION_CATALOG=$RUNNER_TEMP/hammunition/catalog" >> "$GITHUB_ENV" \
            || echo "no engine catalog: the offline integration test will skip"
        fi
      test-command: BUNKER_NETNS_TEST=1 pytest -W error::DeprecationWarning
```

(The clone names the tag the repository currently pins, so the catalog matches the installed engine; Task 11 moves it with the pin and a test holds them together. The test additionally needs `CI=true`, which GitHub sets. Unmeasured: that `$GITHUB_ENV` carries into the `test-command` step of GYST's `python-ci` and that `RUNNER_TEMP` exists in its distro containers; either failure makes the four engine tests skip, which the log says.) Run `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_packaging.py -q` — Expected: PASS (`test_gyst_pins_agree` and the pin tests read the `uses:` lines, which are unchanged).

`CONTRIBUTING.md`: add a row to *What the checks hold*: "| `tests/test_offline_integration.py` | the whole chain with the internet gone: a signed Bunker served inside a network namespace where nothing else answers, the pinned engine installing a data unit from it, and a missing catalogue, a bad signature and an older serial each refused |"; and a section "The offline integration test" saying: it needs `unshare -r -n` (or passwordless `sudo`), the engine's catalog directory in `HAMMUNITION_CATALOG`, and the two environment variables; that it **writes engine state into a throwaway HOME and must never be run on a machine whose Hammunition station matters** (use the CI runner or a VM); and that the harness is local until GYST has a reusable "run with no network except named hosts" step.

File the GYST issue (the spec asks for it when the plan is written; it is the only step here that is not a commit). Check the account first (`ghwho`, `ghsw` to switch: GYST is a personal-account repository), then:

```bash
gh issue create --repo ChiefGyk3D/git-your-ship-together \
  --title "A reusable step that runs a command with no network except named hosts" \
  --body "Several suite repositories need to prove that something works offline: the Hammunition Bunker's integration test runs the engine in a network namespace where only the Bunker answers (unshare -r -n, falling back to sudo -n unshare -n on hosted runners). That harness is local to the Bunker repository today (tests/netns.py). A reusable GYST step or workflow input that runs a command with no network except named hosts would let other repositories (Hammunition itself, Penguin Overlord, the offline docs server) call it instead of copying it. Measured: unshare -r -n works unprivileged on a Debian 13 laptop; not measured: sudo -n unshare -n on ubuntu-24.04 hosted runners, and inside container jobs."
```

`CHANGELOG.md`: "- An integration test that runs the pinned engine in a network namespace where only the Bunker answers: an offline data-unit install succeeds; a missing catalogue, a bad signature and an older serial each refuse. It runs only where `BUNKER_NETNS_TEST=1` and a throwaway environment is declared, and `ci.yml`'s install and test commands set that up (the `uses:` pin is untouched)."

Run: `make check; echo "exit=$?"` — Expected: `exit=0`.

```bash
git add tests/netns.py tests/netns_scenario.py tests/test_offline_integration.py .github/workflows/ci.yml CONTRIBUTING.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Integration test: the pinned engine offline against a signed Bunker

A network namespace with only loopback holds the Bunker's server and the
engine; an offline data-unit install succeeds, and a missing catalogue, a bad
signature and an older serial each refuse. Gated to throwaway environments."
```

### Task 11: Pin the engine release that contains Plan A

Everything above was written against a local checkout of the Plan A branch. This task makes the released engine the pinned one: its tag moves in every place the repository names it (held together by tests), the floor rises to the release that has `hammunition.catalogue`, `hammunition.keystrength`, `hammunition.signers` and `hammunition.gitbundles`, the skips that waited for it become failures, and the docs stop saying a mirror cannot make an install work offline. **Needs that release to exist.** Its tag is decided at release (Plan A ships in v0.22.0 only if nothing else claims that number), so the number is written once, as the shell variable `ENGINE` in Step 1, and every command below reads it; no test or code in this plan names it (`bunker.ENGINE_CONTRACT` is the one constant, and the tests read that). Cutting the Bunker release itself (`__version__`, the image tags, moving the changelog under a version) is the maintainer's step per CONTRIBUTING.md and is not done here.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/bunker/__init__.py` (14-33), `src/bunker/enginelib.py` (`validate_catalogue`), `pyproject.toml` (23), `Dockerfile` (23, 26), `.github/workflows/live.yml` (31), `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (comment 8-9 and the Task 10 `--branch`), `README.md` (25, 80), `CONTRIBUTING.md` (94), `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/reference.md` (139, 257), `docs/guide.md` (26-32, 183-187), `CHANGELOG.md`, `tests/plan_a.py`, `tests/helpers.py` (10), `tests/conftest.py` (87), `tests/test_kinds.py` (113), `tests/test_doctor.py` (39, 45), `tests/test_engine.py` (103, 259-262), `tests/test_run.py` (the `engine_version` assertion Task 1 wrote), `tests/test_repo_hygiene.py` (75-91), `tests/golden/doctor.json`, `tests/golden/run.json`, `tests/golden/status.json`, `tests/golden/keys.json`

- Produces: `bunker.ENGINE_CONTRACT` and `bunker.ENGINE_FLOOR`, both that release; `plan_a.REQUIRE_PLAN_A = True`; `enginelib.validate_catalogue` that raises instead of skipping when the module is missing.

- [ ] **Step 1: Name the release once, and measure it (CONTRIBUTING.md, "Cutting a release", step 2)**

```bash
ENGINE=0.22.0   # the engine release that contains Plan A: the only place the number is written
OLD="$(python3 -c 'import bunker; print(bunker.ENGINE_CONTRACT)')"   # 0.21.0 today
tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
curl -fLo "$tmp/engine.tar.gz" "https://github.com/Renegade-Penguin/Hammunition/archive/refs/tags/v${ENGINE}.tar.gz"
sha256sum "$tmp/engine.tar.gz"
curl -fLo "$tmp/engine2.tar.gz" "https://github.com/Renegade-Penguin/Hammunition/archive/refs/tags/v${ENGINE}.tar.gz"
sha256sum "$tmp/engine2.tar.gz"
gzip -dc "$tmp/engine.tar.gz" | git get-tar-commit-id
git ls-remote https://github.com/Renegade-Penguin/Hammunition "refs/tags/v${ENGINE}^{}"
```

Expected: the two digests are identical (measured twice), and the commit id in the archive equals the tag's commit from `ls-remote`. If either differs, stop: do not fill the digest. If the release is not tagged `v0.22.0`, change the one `ENGINE=` line. Keep `$ENGINE`, `$OLD` and `$tmp` for the steps below (one shell).

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests**

In `tests/test_repo_hygiene.py` add (after `test_engine_floor_agrees`):

```python
def test_every_place_that_names_the_engine_names_the_pinned_release() -> None:
    contract = re.escape(bunker.ENGINE_CONTRACT)
    live = (ROOT / ".github" / "workflows" / "live.yml").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    assert re.search(rf"^\s+ref: v{contract}$", live, re.M), "live.yml checks out another engine"
    ci = (ROOT / ".github" / "workflows" / "ci.yml").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    assert re.search(rf"--branch v{contract} ", ci), "ci.yml fetches another engine's catalog"
    assert f"Hammunition v{bunker.ENGINE_CONTRACT}" in (ROOT / "README.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    assert f"tags/v{bunker.ENGINE_CONTRACT}.tar.gz" in (ROOT / "CONTRIBUTING.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")


def test_the_floor_is_the_release_that_has_the_catalogue_modules() -> None:
    assert bunker.ENGINE_FLOOR == bunker.ENGINE_CONTRACT


def test_the_pinned_engine_has_everything_the_catalogue_needs() -> None:
    import importlib

    for module in (
        "hammunition.catalogue",
        "hammunition.keystrength",
        "hammunition.signers",
        "hammunition.gitbundles",
    ):
        importlib.import_module(module)


def test_the_plan_a_skips_are_failures_now() -> None:
    from tests import plan_a

    assert plan_a.REQUIRE_PLAN_A is True
```

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_repo_hygiene.py -q` — Expected: FAIL: `test_the_floor_is_the_release_that_has_the_catalogue_modules` (`'0.19.0' != '0.21.0'`) and `test_the_plan_a_skips_are_failures_now`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Move the pin**

`src/bunker/__init__.py`: set `ENGINE_FLOOR` and `ENGINE_CONTRACT` both to the `ENGINE` number, and rewrite the two comment blocks above them (14-33) to say: the floor is the oldest release with `hammunition.catalogue`, `hammunition.keystrength`, `hammunition.signers` and `hammunition.gitbundles` (the Bunker cannot publish, classify a key or name a bundle without them), and the contract is the newest release whose `artifacts` document the check table was written against; keep the sentence that `ENGINE_CONTRACT` is the pin and `tests/test_repo_hygiene.py` holds the three together.

```bash
sed -i "s#Hammunition@v${OLD}#Hammunition@v${ENGINE}#" pyproject.toml
sed -i "s#^ARG ENGINE_VERSION=${OLD}#ARG ENGINE_VERSION=${ENGINE}#" Dockerfile
sed -i "s#ref: v${OLD}#ref: v${ENGINE}#" .github/workflows/live.yml
sed -i "s#--branch v${OLD} #--branch v${ENGINE} #; s#(Hammunition v${OLD})#(Hammunition v${ENGINE})#" .github/workflows/ci.yml
sed -i "s#Hammunition v${OLD}#Hammunition v${ENGINE}#" README.md
sed -i "s#tags/v${OLD}.tar.gz#tags/v${ENGINE}.tar.gz#" CONTRIBUTING.md
digest="$(sha256sum "$tmp/engine.tar.gz" | cut -d' ' -f1)"
sed -i "s#^ARG ENGINE_SHA256=.*#ARG ENGINE_SHA256=${digest}#" Dockerfile
git diff --stat
```

Expected: eight files changed; `git diff Dockerfile` shows `ENGINE_VERSION` and `ENGINE_SHA256` only (the digest equal to Step 1's). The `uses:` pin lines of the workflows are untouched (`git diff .github` shows the two `ref`/`--branch` lines and the comment).

Update the `ci.yml` comment (lines 8-9) to say the pinned engine "has `hammunition.catalogue`, `keystrength`, `signers` and `gitbundles`, `mirror enrol` and `install --offline`, and every check kind's engine method".

- [ ] **Step 4: Make the waits strict**

`tests/plan_a.py`: `REQUIRE_PLAN_A = True`. `src/bunker/enginelib.py`:

```python
def validate_catalogue(data: bytes) -> None:
    """Raise unless the engine's own reader accepts *data*: the Bunker never
    publishes a document a laptop would refuse."""
    catalogue_module().parse(data)
```

Constants that stand for "the engine's version" in tests: `tests/helpers.py` line 10 `ENGINE_VERSION = "<ENGINE>"`, `tests/conftest.py` line 87 and `tests/test_kinds.py` line 113 defaults likewise (write them with `sed -i "s#\"${OLD}\"#\"${ENGINE}\"#"` on those three lines only); `tests/test_doctor.py` line 39 `assert ENGINE_VERSION in ...` (import it from `tests.helpers`) and line 45 `assert not check.ok and ENGINE_FLOOR in check.detail` (import `ENGINE_FLOOR` from `bunker`); `tests/test_engine.py` line 103 `assert listing.engine_version == ENGINE_VERSION`, and the `test_meets_floor` parameters (259-262) become `[(ENGINE_FLOOR, True), ("99.0.0", True), ("0.19.0", False), ("0.16.0", False)]`; `tests/test_run.py`: the Task 1 assertion on `raw["engine_version"]` compares to `ENGINE_VERSION`. Leave `tests/data/engine-v0.21.0-repeater-snapshots.json` and the tests that name v0.21.0 as a capture alone: they record what that release printed.

Then regenerate the goldens on a fresh venv installed from the pinned tag (the environment the maintainer's CI will have):

```bash
rm -rf .venv && make venv
BUNKER_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py -q
git diff tests/golden
```

Expected diff: `doctor.json` (`Hammunition <ENGINE> answers (floor <ENGINE>)`), `run.json`, `status.json` (`engine_version`) and `keys.json` (the same). Nothing else may change; read it.

- [ ] **Step 5: Docs**

`docs/reference.md` line 139: the floor is now the pinned release (the first with the catalogue modules and `hammunition.gitbundles`); line 257: "the engine this Bunker pins emits it". `docs/guide.md` lines 26-32: the laptop needs the pinned Hammunition release or later for the signed catalogue and offline planning; the older sentences about 0.19.0 and 0.21.0 are replaced by one: older engines still take files from a mirror (D-070) but cannot read the catalogue or plan offline. Replace the paragraph at 183-187 ("**A mirror does not make an install work offline.** ...") with:

```markdown
**Offline planning.** `hammunition mirror enrol http://<nas-address>:8080/` fetches the catalogue and its
signatures, shows each signing key (algorithm, size, hardware or file, fingerprint, any weak-key warning)
and asks you to type the fingerprint of at least one, as the repository-key step does. From then on
`hammunition install --offline` plans from the repository's pins and this Bunker's signed catalogue and
contacts no publisher; without the flag, a publisher that stays unreachable falls back to the catalogue
and the plan says so. A signature means "this Bunker recorded this", never more: a pinned artifact is
still checked against the repository's sha256, and what the Bunker could only record (a publisher's
MD5, an ETag) is checked against that and said so in the plan. The catalogue is replaced by a newer
serial and refused if the serial goes backwards (`hammunition mirror accept-older` after you have
restored the Bunker from a backup). Hammunition's own
[LAN mirror guide](https://github.com/Renegade-Penguin/Hammunition/blob/main/docs/guides/lan-mirror.md)
describes the laptop side.
```

`README.md` status block (line 25 area): the engine paragraph names the pinned Hammunition release and "every check kind the document can emit, the catalogue modules and the git bundle names". `CLAUDE.md` invariants: change "**One verifier.** Every download goes through the engine's own `hammunition.fetch.Fetcher`" to also say "and every catalogue the Bunker writes must pass the engine's own `hammunition.catalogue.parse()` before it is published (`bunker.publish`)", and the Layout block to add `signing, keys, publish, enrol, inputs, gitbundle, export`. `CHANGELOG.md` under *Unreleased → Changed*, with the real numbers from `$OLD` and `$ENGINE`: "- The engine pin is Hammunition v<ENGINE> (was v<OLD>): `ENGINE_CONTRACT`, `ENGINE_FLOOR` (now the same release: the Bunker needs `hammunition.catalogue`, `hammunition.keystrength`, `hammunition.signers` and `hammunition.gitbundles`), `pyproject.toml`, the Dockerfile (tag and the tag archive's sha256, measured twice, commit equal to the tag's), the live workflow's ref and `ci.yml`'s catalog clone. `bunker doctor` reports an engine below the floor. The skips that waited for the release are failures."

- [ ] **Step 6: Run everything on the pinned engine and commit**

```bash
make check; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected: `exit=0`, with no test skipped for a missing Plan A module: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -rs 2>&1 | grep -i "plan a"` prints nothing (this `grep` reads the report; the gate is the `exit=` line above, not this). Also run the integration test where it can run (a throwaway VM or the CI runner): `BUNKER_NETNS_TEST=1 BUNKER_NETNS_THROWAWAY=1 HAMMUNITION_CATALOG=<the catalog directory of that release> .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_offline_integration.py -q` — Expected: five PASS. If an engine command line in `tests/netns.py::EngineDriver` is wrong, fix it there and re-run; that is the end of the Plan A assumptions.

```bash
git add src/bunker/__init__.py src/bunker/enginelib.py pyproject.toml Dockerfile .github/workflows/live.yml .github/workflows/ci.yml README.md CONTRIBUTING.md CLAUDE.md docs/reference.md docs/guide.md CHANGELOG.md tests
git commit -m "Pin the Hammunition release that contains Plan A; the floor rises with it

ENGINE_CONTRACT, ENGINE_FLOOR, the pyproject pin, the Dockerfile tag and tag
archive digest, the live workflow ref and the CI catalog clone move together,
held by tests; the Plan A skips become failures; the guide describes offline
planning instead of saying a mirror cannot make an install work offline."
```

## Self-review

Written from the Bunker code at `origin/main` (dc668e7, engine pin v0.21.0), the spec, the contract as amended (Hammunition commit 27ab4e34) and Plan A (`2026-10-07-offline-bunker-engine.md`, 19 tasks, read for names, signatures, wording and the rules its reader enforces); the plan itself has not been executed against the repository. Measured in a scratch directory: `ssh-keygen -Y sign` (stdin, namespace `hammunition-bunker-catalogue`) and `-Y verify` with Ed25519, ECDSA P-384 and RSA 1024/2048/3072 keys on OpenSSH 10.3; a real `ssh-agent` signing through a `.pub` file with no private key beside it (and the fallback to the private key when one *is* beside it, which is why the agent test copies the `.pub` alone); the SHA256 fingerprint computed in pure Python equal to `ssh-keygen -l`; principal and namespace mismatches failing; `ssh-keygen` refusing RSA under 1024 bits; `unshare -r -n` working unprivileged with loopback the only interface and `ENETUNREACH` for any other address (and the loopback-up ioctl the scenario uses); the git clone, `update-ref`, `config --blob` and `bundle create` sequence on local repositories with submodules.

**The contract finding, resolved:** the contract said the engine renders `no-touch-required` into the allowed-signers line. OpenSSH 10.3 rejects it (`allowed:1: bad options: unknown key option`; `-Y verify -O no-touch-required` is `Invalid option`), and the contract was amended: `signers[].no_touch_required` is display-only and never written. This plan writes the field from the key's `no_touch` flag (Tasks 1, 2) and its own local verification writes no touch option. Still unmeasured, and a bench item: whether `-Y verify` enforces the user-presence flag of a touch-required sk signature.

**Grounded in Plan A (was guessed in the first draft):**
- `hammunition.catalogue.parse(raw: bytes) -> Catalogue`, raising `CatalogueError(ValueError)` with the field named; the rules the writer must meet (signer `id`/`algorithm`/`bits` equal to `classify`, sk keys `hardware: true`, `publisher_name` and `publisher_size` set together and positive, input `path == inputs/<kind>/<name>`, one input per `(kind, region)`, no duplicate `(unit, name)`, `engine_version` nullable), and the OSM and Copernicus rows its resolvers read (`publisher_url` the dated URL, `publisher_size == size`, an MD5 digest, check `md5`/`md5-publisher` or `etag-md5`/`md5`). Tasks 1 and 4.
- `keystrength.classify(line) -> KeyStrength(..., fingerprint)`, raising `ValueError` (DSA, mismatched blob, missing `ssh-keygen`); `warning` `None` unless weak. Task 3.
- `artifacts --json` (Plan A Task 16): payloads are `sha256` entries with a null size and the licence "licence not recorded in this manifest"; sheets are `etag-md5` (US Topo, 3DEP) and `sha256`/`unverified-fetch` (FSTopo); **no new check kinds**; inputs are `{kind, region, name, url, sha256, size, content, deferred}` with the engine's own record text; git pins are a separate `git_pins` array `{unit, name, repo, ref, commit, submodules, deferred}`, and the Bunker enumerates the gitlinks. The first draft's `etag`/`sized` kinds, `publisher_*` artifact fields and fetched outlines are gone. Tasks 4 and 5.
- Engine bundle naming `bundle_name(unit, commit, path=, subcommit=)`: the commit is the top one and the path the whole recursive path; the engine reads the pinned tag from the bundle, so tags are kept. Task 5.
- `mirror enrol URL` asks "Type one or more fingerprints, comma-separated: " only at a terminal (no `--yes`), so the integration test answers it on a pseudo-terminal; `install NAME... --offline --yes`; refusal words: "older than accepted serial … hammunition mirror accept-older", "no enrolled signature verified". The token probes (`fido2-token -L` lines starting `/dev/hidraw<N>:`, `opensc-tool --list-readers` and `--reader N --name` matching PIV) are Plan A's doctor's. Tasks 3 and 10.

**Still not grounded in code or output I read or ran:**
- Anything about a real token, a PIV card in the container, the Immurok, hidraw permissions on a Synology and touch timing on a scheduled refresh; `ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident` failure modes that justify the `ecdsa-sk` retry (the plan retries on any failure and says so). Nothing here touches hardware; the guide lists each as a bench item.
- That `sudo -n unshare -n` works on a GitHub-hosted runner, that `$GITHUB_ENV` and `$RUNNER_TEMP` reach GYST's `python-ci` steps, and that `openssh-client` and `git` exist in the distro-matrix containers (the signing and git tests skip when they do not).
- The Plan A release tag (`ENGINE` in Task 11; v0.22.0 only if nothing else claims it).
- The GYST issue for a reusable no-network step is written out in Task 10 but not filed: I made no network calls and the account choice (`ghwho`, `ghsw`) is the maintainer's.
- The code blocks are not pre-formatted to ruff's style (line length, `# fmt: skip` placement, `__all__` order under RUF022); run `make format` and `ruff check --fix` before `make check`.

## Needs from Plan A

Where Plan A leaves something undefined that Plan B needs, nothing is guessed above; each item names what the Bunker does meanwhile.

1. **Multipart ETag sheets in `artifacts --json`.** Task 16 lists US Topo and 3DEP sheets "using the same unit/name/digest kind as backend" with "carried ETags and size", and Task 9's test row uses `publisher_check="etag-md5"` with `publisher_digest=quad.etag`, but Plan A never states the `check` string or the `digest` shape listed for a multipart ETag (`<md5>-<parts>`). The Bunker assumes `etag-md5` with the ETag as `digest` and checks it with `Fetcher.fetch_etag`; any other check name is refused by name (the existing unknown-kind rule) until the table learns it. Please state it in `docs/reference/bunker-catalogue.md`.
2. **The missing-catalogue refusal.** Plan A words the older-serial and bad-signature refusals; for `install --offline` against a Bunker whose `catalogue.json` is gone it says only that the transport read fails. The integration test asserts the word "catalogue" and a non-zero exit.
3. **`install UNIT --offline --yes` for a `data` unit.** Whether it needs a saved station, a root-owned data prefix, or writes anywhere but the operator's home; and where the unit lands, so the integration test can assert the file rather than only the exit code and the Bunker's request log.
4. **The size of `artifacts --json` with inputs inline.** Every selection of every requested region is carried as `content` in one document (tens of thousands of terrain tiles for a large region); no bound is stated. The Bunker refuses an input over the engine's 32 MiB reader bound and relies on `[engine] timeout`; a stated bound, or a way to ask for inputs separately, would help.
5. **`--units` and the new arrays.** Whether `--units` filters `inputs` and `git_pins`. The Bunker passes `--units` only when `selection.units` is set, and holds whatever `inputs` and `git_pins` the document carries.
6. **Licences for git pins.** `GitPinEntry` has no licence field; the Bunker records the unit's licence line when an artifact of the same unit carries one, else "licence not recorded in this manifest".
7. **Importing `hammunition.gitbundles` on its own.** The Bunker imports it lazily after `hammunition.backends` (the existing import-order rule of `enginelib`); Plan A notes the backend cycle for `fetch_bundle` but not whether the module imports cleanly in that order.
8. **Whether `hammunition.catalogue.parse` accepts what an empty fresh Bunker publishes** (no artifacts, no inputs, `engine_version` null). The reader model reads as if it does; the first publish on a new volume is the case.

## Resolved by the lead (2026-10-07), overriding "Needs from Plan A"

Plan A and the contract were amended (Hammunition PR #390, commit after 27ab4e34):

1. Sheets: `check: "etag-md5"`, `digest` = the raw ETag as the repo carries it (32 hex, or `<hex>-<parts>` multipart), plus `part_size` (int or null). Task 5 uses these.
2. Missing catalogue refuses with exactly: "no catalogue at <url>/catalogue.json: <reason>. Enrol a Bunker that serves one, or run without --offline." Task 10 asserts this text.
3. Task 10's offline install uses the static pinned data unit `ics-forms`, which needs no station regions, under the test's isolated prefix.
4. `artifacts --json` refuses an inline input over 8 MiB, naming it and suggesting `--units`.
5. `--units` filters `inputs` (by the selected units' regions) and `git_pins` (by unit).
6. Every `git_pins` entry carries `licence` (verbatim from the manifest, or "licence not recorded in this manifest").
7. Plan A Task 15 tests that `hammunition.gitbundles` imports cleanly in a fresh interpreter.
8. `parse` accepts `artifacts: []` and `inputs: []`; `signers` still needs ≥ 1. A fresh Bunker's first signed catalogue is valid.
